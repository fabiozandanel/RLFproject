\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:1}
The presence of large-scale diffuse synchrotron radio emission in clusters of
galaxies proves the existence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields
permeating the intra-cluster medium (ICM) (see
e.g.~\citealp{2004NewAR..48.1137F}).

Diffuse cluster radio emission can be separated in two classes: radio relics and
radio halos (see, e.g.~\citealp{2004rcfg.procE..25K,2008SSRv..134...93F}).
Radio \mbox{(mini-)}halos (RHs) are centered on clusters and characterized by a
regular and unpolarized morphology, resembling the morphology of the thermal
X-ray emission. On the contrary, radio relics typically lie at the cluster
outskirts, have an irregular morphology, and often show a high degree of
polarization. While relics seem to directly trace structure formation shocks
(see, e.g.~\citealp{2011A&A...533A..35V}), the explanation for the RHs phenomenon
is challenging and still an open question.
                                   
Two principal models have been proposed to explain RHs.  In the ``hadronic
model'' the radio emitting electrons are produced in cosmic ray (CR)
proton-proton interactions within the ICM, requiring only a very modest fraction
of a few percent of CR-to-thermal pressure (see
\citealp{1980ApJ...239L..93D,1982AJ.....87.1266V, 1999APh....12..169B,
  2000A&A...362..151D, 2001ApJ...559...59M, 2001ApJ...562..233M,
  2003A&A...407L..73P, 2004A&A...413...17P, 2004MNRAS.352...76P,
  2007IJMPA..22..681B, 2008MNRAS.385.1211P, 2008MNRAS.385.1242P,
  2009JCAP...09..024K, 2010MNRAS.401...47D, 2010arXiv1003.0336D,
  2010arXiv1003.1133K, 2010arXiv1011.0729K, 2011A&A...527A..99E}).  CR protons
and heavier nuclei, like electrons, can be accelerated and injected into the ICM
by structure formation shocks, active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galactic winds.
Due to their higher masses with respect to electrons, CR protons are accelerated
more efficiently to relativistic energies and are expected to show a ratio of
the spectral energy flux of CR protons-to-electrons above 1 GeV of about 100,
similarly to what is observed in our Galaxy
\citep{2002cra..book.....S}. Additionally, CR protons have radiative cooling
times larger than electrons by the square of the mass ratio and therefore can
accumulate in clusters for cosmological times
\citep{1996SSRv...75..279V}. Indeed, CR electrons suffer more severe energy
losses via synchrotron and inverse Compton emission at GeV energies, and Coulomb
losses below 100~MeV.  In the ``re-acceleration model'', RHs are thought to be
the result of re-acceleration of electrons through interactions with plasma
waves during powerful states of ICM turbulence, as a consequence of a cluster
merger (see \citealp{1987A&A...182...21S, 1993ApJ...406..399G,
  2002A&A...386..456G, 2004MNRAS.350.1174B, 2005MNRAS.363.1173B,
  2007MNRAS.378..245B, 2010arXiv1008.0184B, 2009A&A...507..661B}). This,
however, requires a sufficiently long-lived CR electron population at energies
around 100~MeV which has to be provided by re-acceleration at a rate faster than
the cooling processes.  We refer the reader to \citet{2011A&A...527A..99E} for a
discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of these two models.

RHs can be divided in two classes. Giant radio halos are typically associated
with merging clusters and have large extensions, e.g. the Coma radio halo has an
extension of about 2~Mpc. Radio mini-halos are associated with relaxed clusters
that harbor a cool core and typically extend over a few hundred kilo-parsecs,
e.g. the Perseus radio mini-halo has an extension of about 0.2~Mpc.  The
observed morphological similarities with the thermal X-ray emission suggests RHs
may be of hadronic origin. In fact, cool-core clusters (CCC) are characterized
by very high thermal X-ray emissivity and very peaked ICM densities in
comparison to merging non cool-core clusters (NCCC) (see
e.g.~\citealp{2008A&A...487..431C}). This dramatic difference in the ICM density
of CCC and NCCC is reflected in the two observed classes of RHs.

The RHs luminosity seems to be correlated to the thermal X-ray luminosity (see,
e.g.~\citealp{2009A&A...507..661B,2011A&A...527A..99E}).  However, a large
fraction of clusters do not exhibit significant diffuse synchrotron emission of
any kind. Galaxy clusters with the same thermal X-ray luminosity show an
apparent bimodality with respect to their radio luminosity. Either they harbor a
RH or they do not have any detectable diffuse radio emission.  This suggests the
existence of a switch-on/switch-off mechanism able to change the radio
luminosity by more than one order of magnitude.  While such a mechanism could be
easily realized in the framework of the re-acceleration model
\citep{2009A&A...507..661B}, the \emph{classical} hadronic model predicts the
presence of RHs in all clusters. The failure to reproduce the observed cluster
radio-to-X-ray bimodality was one of the main criticisms against the hadronic
model. Additionally, the \emph{classical} hadronic model cannot reproduce some
spectral features observed in clusters, such as the total spectral curvature
claimed in the Coma radio halo or the spectral steepening observed at the
boundary of some RHs. In a recent work, \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} assess this
problem by analyzing CR transport processes within a cluster. While CR advection
with the bulk flow results in centrally enhanced CR profiles, the propagation in
form of CR streaming and diffusion produces flat CR profiles. Hence, different
CR transport phenomena may also account for the observed bimodality of the radio
luminosity in the hadronic model and may also explain the spectral features
observed in some clusters \citep{2011A&A...527A..99E}. Note that these CR
transport phenomena were not considered in earlier analytical works (see,
e.g.~\citealp{2004A&A...413...17P}) as well as in hydrodynamic simulations (see,
e.g.~\citealp{2001ApJ...562..233M, 2008MNRAS.385.1211P, 2010MNRAS.409..449P}).

More recently, \cite{2012MNRAS.421L.112B} presented the first scaling relations
between RH luminosity and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) flux measurements, using the
\emph{Planck} cluster catalogue. While the correlation agrees with previous
scaling measurements based on X-ray data, there is no indication for a bimodal
cluster population dividing clusters into radio-loud and radio-quiet objects at
fixed SZ flux. While the SZ flux correlates tightly with cluster mass, the X-ray
luminosity, $L_\rmn{X}$, exhibits a larger scatter. The CCCs predominantly
populate the high-$L_\rmn{X}$ tail (at any cluster temperature) and make up
approximately half of the radio-quiet objects \citep{2011A&A...527A..99E}
suggesting that the switch-on/switch-off mechanism may not operate at fixed
$L_\rmn{X}$ but also cause an evolution of that quantity, i.e. $L_\rmn{X}$
increases as the cluster relaxes, cools and forms a denser core after a merger
which may simultaneously decrease the radio luminosity.
 
An observational test that is able to disentangle between the hadronic and
re-acceleration models is the gamma-ray emission resulting from neutral pion
decays, a secondary product of the hadronic CR interaction with protons of the
ICM, which is not predicted by the re-acceleration model. Such observational
efforts have been undertaken in the last few years (for space-based cluster
observations in the GeV-band, see \citealt{2003ApJ...588..155R,
  2010ApJ...717L..71A, 2010JCAP...05..025A, 2012AAS...21920701Z,
  2012arXiv1201.1003H}; for ground-based observations in the energy band
$>100$~GeV, see \citealt{2006ApJ...644..148P, 2008AIPC.1085..569P,
  2009A&A...495...27A, 2009arXiv0907.0727T, 2009arXiv0907.3001D,
  2009arXiv0907.5000G, cangaroo_clusters, 2009ApJ...706L.275A,
  2010ApJ...710..634A, 2011arXiv1111.5544M}) without being able to detect
cluster gamma-ray emission\footnote[1]{Recently, \cite{2012arXiv1201.1003H}
  claimed an evidence for diffuse gamma-ray emission in the \emph{Fermi}
  satellite data of the Virgo cluster which however needs to be carefully
  scrutinized by varying the uncertain foreground modeling (for a preliminary
  assessment of the \emph{Fermi} collaboration, see Elliot Bloom's talk at the
  UCLA Dark Matter 2012 conference, https://hepconf.physics.ucla.edu/dm12/).}.
Despite the negative detections, gamma-ray limits enable us to put significant
constraints on the relative CR pressure contributions. The long observation
campaign of the Perseus galaxy cluster performed by the Major Atmospheric
Gamma-ray Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes constrains the cluster average
CR-to-thermal pressure to be less than a few percent
\citep{2010ApJ...710..634A,2011arXiv1111.5544M}. Comparing the corresponding
upper limits to predictions of simulations by \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}
constrains the maximum CR acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks
to be $<50\%$.  Alternatively, this may indeed suggest the presence of
non-negligible CR transport processes into the outer cluster regions as
suggested by \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}.  Constraints at the same level are
confirmed also by the \emph{Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT) data on the Coma
cluster \citep{2011PhRvD..84l3509P, 2012AAS...21920701Z,
  2012arXiv1201.1003H}. To summarize, gamma-ray observations are not yet
sensitive enough to severely challenge hadronic models of RHs.

An important step towards understanding the generating mechanism of RHs would
come from detailed RH population analyses. To date, we know only of 30 clusters
that harbor RHs (see \citealp{2011A&A...527A..99E}, for an almost up-to-date
list). Only two X-ray flux-limited studies have been conducted that assess the
important question of the RH frequency in clusters \citep{1999NewA....4..141G,
  VenturiGMRT_2}. Since the number of RHs in such X-ray flux-limited samples is
small with typically a few RHs, the conclusions on the underlying physical
mechanisms of RHs are not very robust. Fortunately, this is going to change
thanks to the next-generation of low-frequency radio observatories such as the
Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) which officially started operations in
2010.\footnote[2]{www.lofar.org} In fact, a deep cluster survey is part of the
LOFAR science key projects and expected to provide a large number of
radio-emitting galaxy clusters up to redshift $z\approx1$ (see
e.g.~\citealp{2010A&A...509A..68C,2012JApA..tmp...34R}).  This will hopefully
permit to clearly determine the RHs phenomenology with respect to galaxy cluster
properties such as radio-loud/quiet, non cool-core/cool-core and
non-merging/merging clusters, and exploring the role of different parameters
like the magnetic field, the CR acceleration efficiency, and the CR transport
properties.

In this work, we present predictions for the RHs of a complete cosmological
sample of galaxy clusters up to $z= 1$, obtained from the MultiDark N-body
cosmological simulation \citep{2011arXiv1104.5130P}. We construct a
\emph{phenomenological} model to assign a gas density profile to each halo in
the MultiDark simulation that is based on observed X-ray cluster properties. We
assume that the RHs are generated by secondaries of the hadronic CR interactions
with the ICM. In adopting the hadronic scenario, we construct a \emph{hybrid}
model merging the result of hydrodynamic simulations by
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} and the analytical model by
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}.  As anticipated above, the inclusion of the latter
is particularly important as CR transport processes have a dramatic impact on
the emission profile and normalization. We will show that this approach enables
us not only to reproduce the radio surface brightness profiles but also the
radio-to-X-ray and radio-to-SZ scaling relations. Hence, this explicitly
demonstrates that the hadronic model is an attractive model matching all current
observational constraints and predict luminosity functions for the LOFAR cluster
survey.

In Section~\ref{sec:2}, we explain the methodology of assigning gas density
profiles to DM halos and demonstrate that the model reproduces the observed
X-ray scaling relations and luminosity function. We then construct the model for
the CR distribution in clusters. In Section~\ref{sec:3}, we apply our model to
observed surface brightness profiles of individual RHs and explore the allowable
parameter space for CRs and magnetic fields. In Section~\ref{sec:4}, we compare
the modeled radio-to-X-ray and radio-to-SZ scaling relations to current
observations and show how they vary for different choices 
of our CR and magnetic parameterizations. In Section~\ref{sec:5}, we show 
the radio luminosity functions, compare them to current observational
constraints and provide predictions for the LOFAR cluster survey. Finally, in
Section~\ref{sec:6}, we present our conclusions. In this work, the cluster mass
$M_{\Delta}$ and radius $R_{\Delta}$ are defined with respect to a density that
is $\Delta=200$ or $\Delta=500$ times the \emph{critical} density of
universe. We adopt density parameters of $\Omega_{\rm{m}}=0.3$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7$ and today's Hubble constant of $H_0 = 100 \times
h_{70}$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$ where $h_{70} = 0.7$.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:2}
The two fundamental ingredients of this work are the cosmological simulation of
the Universe from which we construct our complete cluster sample, and the
emission model. Here, we use the MultiDark simulation that will be described in
Section~\ref{sec:2.1}, along with our final cluster sample. As we will see, for
any given cluster, the necessary ingredients for the emission model are mass,
temperature, and gas density distribution. We construct a complete cluster
sample from an N-body cosmological simulation, i.e. a \emph{DM-only} simulation,
where we assign to each object a gas density profile phenomenologically
constructed from state-of-art X-ray observations, as shown in
Section~\ref{sec:2.2}. In doing this, we show that the approach can reproduce
the known X-ray cluster characteristics, such as the X-ray luminosity function
(XLF), the luminosity-mass relation, $L_{\rmn{X}}- M$, and the $Y_{\rm{X}}-M$
relation, where $Y_{\rm{X}}=M_\rmn{gas}k_{\rm{B}}T_{\rmn{X}}$ with an X-ray-derived gas
mass $M_{\rmn{gas}}$ and the temperature $T_{\rmn{X}}$
\citep{2006ApJ...650..128K}. Moreover we compare our $Y_{\rm{SZ}}-M$ relation
with SZ-derived measurements.  Only if our model matches available cluster data on
the gas properties, we can start to explore different parametrizations of CR
physics and its implications for the radio and gamma-ray emission, explained in
Section~\ref{sec:2.3}.

\subsection{MultiDark Simulation and Final Cluster Sample}
\label{sec:2.1}
The MultiDark simulation\footnote[3]{www.multidark.org} used in this work is
described in detail in \cite{2011arXiv1104.5130P} and
\cite{2011arXiv1109.0003R}.  It is a $N$-body cosmological simulation done with
the the Adaptive-Refinement-Tree (ART) code \citep{1997ApJS..111...73K} of
$2048^3$ particles within a ($1000$~Mpc~$h^{-1}$)$^3$ cube. The latest WMAP5 and
WMAP7 cosmological parameters were used. This simulation is particularly well
suited for our purpose because of its large number clusters.
 
We use the MultiDark halo catalog, constructed with the Bound Density Maxima
algorithm \citep{1997astro.ph.12217K}.  We will mainly use $M_{500}$ and
$R_{500}$ for comparison with existing observational works.  We use the
technique described in \cite{2003ApJ...584..702H} to convert $M_{200}$ and
$R_{200}$ provided by the MultiDark halo catalog to $M_{500}$ and $R_{500}$.  In
creating our cluster sample we only select distinct halos, i.e. those halos that
are not sub-halos of any other halo, which by definition are not galaxy clusters.

Additionally, we assume that the main emission mechanism in the ICM is thermal
bremsstrahlung, which is true only above approximately
$3\times10^{7}$~$\rmn{K}\approx2.6$~keV \citep{1988xrec.book.....S}. Below this
temperature, there could be other important contributions to the emission,
e.g. from atomic lines. Therefore, we impose a mass cut of
$M_{200}\geq1\times10^{14}$~$h^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}\approx1.4\times10^{14}$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}$
which ensures $kT \gtrsim 2.6$~keV, assuming the $M_{500} - T_{\rm{ci}}$ relation
of \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}.

The LOFAR radio observatory is expected to detect RHs up to redshift $z \approx
1$. Thus, we make use of different simulation snapshots up to $z=1$. In
Table~\ref{tab:z}, we show the total cluster number in our final cluster sample
at different redshifts.

\end{table}

\subsection{Gas Density Modeling}
\label{sec:2.2}

We decided to use a \emph{phenomenological} approach and to construct the gas
density profiles directly from X-ray observations. A suitable X-ray sample that
provides the needed information is the \emph{Representative XMM-Newton Cluster
  Structure Survey} (REXCESS) sample \citep{2008A&A...487..431C,
  2009A&A...498..361P}. It is a sample of 31 galaxy clusters of different
dynamical states at redshift $0.06<z<0.18$ with detailed information of the
de-projected electron density profiles \citep{2008A&A...487..431C}. In
Figure~\ref{fig:gas_profiles}, we show the 31 electron density profiles of the
REXCESS sample color-coded by cool-core and non-cool-core clusters (hereafter
CCCs and NCCCs, respectively).

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/gas_profiles.eps}
\caption{Electron density profiles of the 31 clusters in the REXCESS sample. Grey and black lines represent NCCCs and CCCs, respectively. The blue and red lines represent our GNFW mean profile for the NCCCs and CCCs, respectively.}
\label{fig:gas_profiles}
\end{figure}

In order to obtain a general electron density profile that we will attach to our
simulated clusters, we use a generalized Navarro-Frank-White (GNFW) profile,
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm{e}}(x) = \frac{n_{0}}{x^{\beta}\left[1+x^{\alpha}\right]^{\frac{\delta-\beta}{\alpha}}},
\label{eq:gnfw}
\end{equation}
where $x=R/R_{\rm{c}}$ and $R_{\rm{c}}$ is the cluster core radius. To reduce
the dimensionality of our fit, we fix representative values of $R_{\rm{c}} =
0.2\, R_{500}$, $\alpha = 1$ and $\delta = 2.5$. We fit the REXCESS profiles in
log-log space, separating them in the two categories of NCCCs and CCCs as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:gas_profiles}. The resulting fits are shown in blue and red
for the NCCC and CCC population, respectively. We obtain $n_{\rm{0,NCCC}} =
1.02\times10^{-2}$~$h_{70}^{1/2}$~cm$^{-3}$, $n_{\rm{0,CCC}} =
8.32\times10^{-3}$~$h_{70}^{1/2}$~cm$^{-3}$, $\beta_{\rm{NCCC}} = -0.093$. and
$\beta_{\rm{CCC}} = 0.592$.

The next step is to introduce a mass-scaling in order to apply our GNFW profiles
to all our clusters. We adopt a gas mass fraction-mass scaling,
$f_{gas,500}-M_{500}$ of \cite{2009ApJ...693.1142S} (and adopt their Equation~(8)). We can
express $f_{\rm{gas},500}$ in the following way:
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm{gas},500} = \frac{M_{\rm{gas},500}}{M_{500}}  = \frac{\int_{0}^{R_{500}} \rho_{\rm{gas}} \rmn{d}V}{M_{500}}
\label{eq:m500}
\end{equation}
with $\rho_{\rm{gas}} = n_{\rm{e}} m_{\rm{p}} / ( X_{\rm{H}}X_{\rm{e}} )$ where
$m_{\rm{p}}$ is the proton mass, $X_{\rm{H}} = 0.76$ is the primordial hydrogen
mass fraction and $X_{\rm{e}} = 1.157$ the ratio of electron-hydrogen number
densities in the fully ionized ICM \citep{1988xrec.book.....S}. For each cluster
$i$ of our sample, we then define a \emph{mass-scaled} gas profile as
$\rho_{\rm{gas},i}=C_{i} \,\rho_{\rm{gas}}$ with:
\begin{eqnarray}
%C_{i}  =  (0.0616\pm(0.0060g_{1}))  h_{73}^{-1.5}  \left(\frac{M_{500,i}}{10^{13} h_{73}^{-1} \rmn{M_{\odot}}}\right)^{0.135\pm(0.030g_{2})} \nonumber \\
C_{i}  & = &  (0.0656\pm(0.0064g_{1})) \, h_{70}^{-1.5}  \nonumber \\
 & \times & \left(\frac{M_{500,i}}{1.04 \times 10^{13} h_{70}^{-1} \rmn{M_{\odot}}}\right)^{0.135\pm(0.030g_{2})} \frac{M_{500,i}}{\int_{0}^{R_{500,i}} \rho_{\rm{gas}} \rmn{d}V}
\label{eq:gas_scaling}
\end{eqnarray}
where $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ are random Gaussian number which we use in order to
simulate the natural scatter of the gas profiles.\footnote[4]{The values
  $0.0064$ and $0.03$ quoted in Equation~(\ref{eq:gas_scaling}) do not represent
  the proper scatter of the $f_{\rm{gas},500}-M_{500}$ relation but reflect the
  parameter errors and we rescaled the numerical values to a Hubble constant of
  $h_{70}$ used in this work.}

Hence, for each cluster in our sample we obtain a gas density profile
$\rho_{\rm{gas},i}$ that obeys the observed $f_{gas,500}-M_{500}$ relation and
is uniquely determined by its DM mass $M_{500,i}$ and by the property of being a
NCCC or CCC. We assign the latter property to every halo depending on its
merging history. In particular, we make use of the offset parameter
$X_{\rm{off}}$ computed for the MultiDark halo catalog. This is defined as the
ratio between the distance from the halo center to the center of mass and the
virial radius. The parameter assesses the dynamical state of the cluster and
whether the halo experienced a recent merger or not. Current observations reveal
a ratio of NCCCs and CCCs of about $50\%$ (see, e.g.~\citealp{2007A&A...466..805C,
  2009MNRAS.395..764S}). Since there is a correlation between merging clusters
and NCCCs, we use the median of the $X_{\rm{off}}$ distribution to separate our
sample into CCCs and NCCCs (with NCCCs as those halos with the larger dynamical
offsets). Clearly, this is an over-simplification, and future X-ray surveys will
have to determine this property also as a function of redshift.

We also account for redshift evolution of the gas profiles. While our NCCC and
CCC gas profiles as derived from the REXCESS cluster sample are merely used to
define a profile shape, the normalization of the gas profiles is set by the
observational $f_{\rm{gas},500}-M_{500}$ relation \citep{2009ApJ...693.1142S}.
The 43 clusters used in \cite{2009ApJ...693.1142S} have redshifts $0.012 < z <
0.12$ with a \emph{median} of $z \approx 0.04$. Thus, our phenomenological gas
profile is representative of the cluster population at $z=0$. To extend this
profile to high-$z$, we include a \emph{self-similar} scaling of the gas density
as $\rho_{\rm{gas}}(z) = E(z)^{2} \rho_{\rm{gas}}(z=0)$, where $E(z)^{2} =
\Omega_{\rm{m}} (1+z)^{3} + \Omega_{{\Lambda}}$.


\subsection{X-ray and SZ scaling relations}

In order to check whether our phenomenologically derived gas profiles reproduce
the observations, we calculate the bolometric X-ray thermal bremsstrahlung
luminosity $L_{\rm{bol}}$ as in \cite{1988xrec.book.....S}\footnote[5]{We check
  our procedure by fitting each of the 31 REXCESS clusters with
  equation~(\ref{eq:gnfw}) and calculating $L_{\rm{bol}}$ with the measured gas
  temperature of each cluster. As a result, we fall short to the observed
  luminosity by a mean (median) of about $21\%$ ($20\%$). This is reasonable
  considering that we do not permit the parameters $R_{\rm{c}}$, $\alpha$ and
  $\gamma$ to vary between different objects. Additionally, we neglect atomic
  line emission which may give a noticeable contribution, in particularly for
  low-mass clusters and in the cluster outskirts of larger systems.}  and
compare our sample result with the observed $L_{\rm{bol}} - M_{500}$ relation
and XLF.\footnote[6]{The mean (median) difference at $z=0$ between
  $L_{\rm{bol}}$ within $R_{200}$ or within $R_{500}$ is $\approx 5\%$ ($\approx
  7\%$). While $L_{\rm{bol}}$ refers to the quantity calculated within
  $R_{500}$, we note that the XLF for luminosities calculated within $R_{200}$
  will be barely changed.}

To assign a temperature to our model clusters (that is needed for calculating
$L_{\rm{bol}}$ and $Y_{\rmn{X}}$), we adopt the $T-M_{500}$ relation by
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M},
\begin{equation}
\log_{10} \left( \frac{k_{\rm{B}}T_{\rm{ci}}}{\rm{keV}} \right) = 
A + B~\log_{10} \left( \frac{E(z) M_{500}}{10^{15} h_{70}^{-1} \rm{M_{\odot}}} \right)
\label{eq:temp}
\end{equation}
where $A=0.91$, $B=0.46$, $T_{\rm{ci}}$ is the cluster temperature \emph{not}
centrally excised (see \citealp{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}) and $k_{\rm{B}}$ is the
Boltzmann constant. \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} report a scatter of
$\sigma_{\rm{yx}} = 0.06,$\footnote[7]{Scatter is calculated as
  $\sigma_{\rm{yx}} = \sqrt{ \left\{ \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} [Y_{i}-(A+B~X_{i})]^{2}\right\} /
    N-1}$ where the sum extends over the data points $X_{i}, Y_{i}$, and $A$ and $B$
  are the fit parameters.} which we apply to our sample using Gaussian
deviates.

In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:X_LM}, we show how our model
$L_{\rm{bol}}-M_{500}$ relation compares with observations by
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} (\emph{all} data, see their Table~7). Their sample is
composed of 238 clusters at $0.02<z<0.46$ with a median of $z \approx 0.2$ and
self-consistently takes into account all selection effects, covariances,
systematic uncertainties and the cluster mass function. For this reason, we
compare the \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} data to our model at $z=0.2$, and limit
the comparison to the mass range covered by the observations. Overall, there is
reassuring agreement between our phenomenological model and the data, which
probe our model most closely on scales around the cluster core radii (which is
where the contribution to $L_{\rmn{X}}$ per logarithmic interval in radius, $\dd
L_{\rmn{X}}/\dd\ln r \propto r^3 n^2(r) \sqrt{k_{\rm{B}}T}$, attains its maximum).  In
Table~\ref{tab:LMfits}, we show our model $L_{\rm{bol}}-M_{500}$ scaling
relation and its scatter for different redshifts. We find that the scatter of
our samples at all redshifts are Gaussian distributed with a standard deviation
of $\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.18$ that matches the observational results of
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}, which report a scatter of $\sigma_{yx} = 0.185$.

In the middle panel of Figure~\ref{fig:X_LM}, we compare the $Y_{\rm{X}}-M_{500}$
relation of our sample to observational data \citep{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}. The
model agrees nicely at high-mass end, but underpredicts the observed scaling at
low masses by about $20\%$ (at the 1-$\sigma$ level). This is the same level of
deviations from the data as in the case of $L_{\rmn{X}}$, which is more
significant due to the smaller scatter in the $Y_{\rm{X}}$ relation. The
differential contribution to the thermal energy per logarithmic interval in
radius (and hence to the integrated Compton-$y$ parameter), $\dd Y /\dd\ln r
\propto r^3 P(r)$, peaks at scales slightly smaller than $R_{500}$ with
1-$\sigma$ contributions extending out to $3\,R_{500}$
\citep{2010ApJ...725...91B}. Hence, the observational scaling constrains our
model on those large scales, quite complementary to the X-ray luminosity. The
deviations at small masses either indicates different assumptions about
$f_{\rmn{gas}}$, the gas temperature, or different selection effects of either
observational sample that we used to calibrate our model or to compare out
scaling relation to. E.g., \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} determine their masses by
adopting a constant value for $f_{\rm{gas}}$, in contrast to our approach which
adopts the observed $f_{\rm{gas},500}-M_{500}$ relation given by
\cite{2009ApJ...693.1142S}. Additionally, we adopt the \emph{centrally included}
temperature \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} throughout all our work, while
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} use the \emph{centrally excised} temperature to
calculate $Y_{\rm{X}}$. This assumption also impacts the scatter of the
$Y_{\rm{X}}-M$ relation. In fact, using the \emph{centrally included}
temperature, we found a scatter of $\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.11$ (see
Table~\ref{tab:YXfits} where our $Y_{\rm{X}}$ scaling relations are reported),
significantly higher than the value of $\sigma_{yx} = 0.052$ found by
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}.

In the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:X_LM}, we compare the
$Y_{\rm{SZ}}-M_{500}$ relation in our model (calculated as in Equation~(3) of
\citealp{2011arXiv1109.3709B}) with the observed scaling relation
by \cite{2011A&A...536A..11P}. Their sample contains clusters up to $z \approx
0.45$ and has a median of $z \approx 0.15$; hence, we compare the data to our
relation at the MultiDark snapshot $z=0.16$ (containing 11419 clusters above our mass cut) 
which however is not used throughout the rest of the work. Our model reproduces the data remarkably well, 
except for  the high-mass end where our simulations have a weaker constraining power due to the comparably 
small box size in comparison to the survey volume of {\em Planck}. In Table~\ref{tab:YSZfits},
we report our SZ scaling relations for different redshifts. We find a scatter
of $\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.11$ which compares well with the \emph{Planck} result
of $\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.1$.

\subsection{X-ray luminosity function}

The XLF study has been somehow abandoned during the last years due to the
difficulties of using the X-ray luminosity for cosmological purposes. The X-ray
emissivity scales with the square of the gas density, which makes it subject to
density variations and clumping. This implies large scatter that causes a large
Malmquist bias and underlines the necessity of careful mock surveys that need to
address all systematics.

Nevertheless, it provides a complementary check for our model. To this end, we
use the \emph{ROSAT} brightest cluster sample (BCS) XLF
\citep{1997ApJ...479L.101E}, which is in good agreement with results from the
ROSAT ESO Flux-Limited X-ray (REFLEX; \citealp{2002ApJ...566...93B}) and
HIFLUGCS \citep{2002ApJ...567..716R}.  Note that the XLF is fully determined by
the mass function and the $L_{\rmn{X}}-M_{500}$ relation after taking into
account the observational biases. This means that applying the Malmquist bias
corrected $L_{\rmn{X}}-M_{500}$ relation by \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} directly
to the MultiDark mass function and accounting for the observational scatter in
$L_{\rmn{X}}-M_{500}$ should yield an unbiased XLF. We show the resulting
bolometric and soft-band ($0.1-2.4$~keV) XLF in Figure~\ref{fig:XLF} and compare
those to the corresponding BCS XLFs (for which bolometric band there is only the 
Schechter fit available) to our model predictions.  While the soft-band XLF by
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} agrees well with the BCS data points, it deviates
from the corresponding Schechter fit at low luminosities. This is also true in
the bolometric band, where the XLFs of \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} and our model
agree well, but deviate from the BCS Schechter fit at low luminosities. This may
be an artifact due to the use of Schechter fit instead of the data points or may
point to incompleteness of the BCS sample. Note that the Poissonian errors of
the XLF obtained from the MultiDark simulation are a lower limit as we are
neglecting the uncertainty due to cosmic variance.  Studies of the XLF will
become again an important topic with the upcoming launch of the eROSITA
satellite (see e.g.~\citealp{2011MSAIS..17..159C}) and further studies in this
direction are desirable. For these reasons, we do not show XLF predictions at
other redshifts, leaving this for a future study (Zandanel et al., in prep.).

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/xlf.eps}
\caption{Bolometric and soft-band ($0.1-2.4$~keV) XLFs. Shown are the soft-band
  data points, the soft-band and bolometric Schechter fits of the BCS sample of
  \cite{1997ApJ...479L.101E}, which has a median of $z \approx 0.08$.  While the
  soft-band XLF of \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} compares well with the BCS data
  points, it deviates from the corresponding Schechter fit. We also show the
  bolometric XLF of \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} and bolometric XLF of our model at
  $z=0.1$. The XLFs are calculated in equally log-spaced mass bins; the error
  bars represent the Poissonian errors. Note that we limit the comparison to the
  luminosity range covered by our sample, where we cut the lowest part because
  in that range the XLF rapidly drops due to the imposed mass cut.  }
\label{fig:XLF}
\end{figure}

Summarizing, our phenomenological approach provides viable gas densities that
reproduce the observed scaling relations of the ICM as well as the XLF. Thus, we
will apply it in the following to model the CR population in galaxy clusters and
to predict the radio and gamma-ray emission of our sample.

\subsection{Cosmic ray modeling}
\label{sec:2.3}
We assume a power-law CR proton distribution, $f(p) \dd p=C p^\alpha \dd p$,
which is the effective one-dimensional momentum distribution (assuming isotropy
in momentum space). We are interested in calculating the radio synchrotron (and
gamma-ray) emission resulting from secondaries of hadronic CR interactions with
protons of the ICM. To start, we provide the synchrotron emissivity $j_{\nu}$ at
frequency $\nu$ and per steradian of a steady-state electron population where
radiative cooling balaces injection from hadronic interactions (adapted from
\citealp{2008MNRAS.385.1211P} and \citealp{2011A&A...527A..99E}),
\begin{equation}
j_{\nu}  =  A_\nu C(R) \rho_{\rm{gas}}(R) 
\frac{\epsilon_{\rm{B}}(R)}{\epsilon_{\rm{B}}(R)+\epsilon_{\rm{CMB}}} 
\left( \frac{\epsilon_{\rm{B}}(R)}{\epsilon_{B_{\rm{c}}}} \right)^{(\alpha-2)/4},
\label{eq:jnu}
\end{equation}
where the abbreviations $A_\nu$ and $\epsilon_{B_{\rm{c}}}$ are defined in
Appendix~\ref{app:A}, $\epsilon_{\rm{CMB}}$ is the energy density of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), and $\epsilon_B=B^{2}/(8\pi)$ denotes the magnetic
energy density. We assume a scaling of the magnetic field with gas density that
is given by
\begin{equation}
B(R) = B_0\,\left(\frac{\rho(R)}{\rho(0)}\right)^{\alpha_B},
\label{eq:B}
\end{equation}
where $B_0$ is the central magnetic field and $\alpha_{\rm{B}}$ a parameter
representing the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength toward the
cluster outskirts. The radio surface brightness $S_{\nu}(R_{\perp})$ and luminosity
$L_{\nu}$ at a given frequency $\nu$ are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
S(R_{\perp}) &=& 2 \int_{R_{\perp}}^{\infty} j_{\nu}(R) \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^{2}-R_{\perp}^{2}}} \rmn{d}R, \\
L_{\nu}  &=&  4 \pi \int \dd V j_\nu(R).
\label{eq:lum}
\end{eqnarray}
The flux is given by $F_{\nu}=L_{\nu}/(4\pi D^{2})$ where $D$ is the
luminousity distance of the considered object.

The CR distribution within galaxy clusters is governed by an interplay of
propagation and advection. While the advection of CR by turbulent gas motions
tends to result in centrally enhanced CR profiles, the propagation in form of CR
streaming and diffusion tends to produce flat CR profiles. A full discussion of
this issue is beyond the scope of this work and we remind the reader to
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}. What we propose here is to merge the result from the
hydrodynamical cluster cosmological simulation of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P},
which provides a mass-scaling for the CR normalization, and the analytical
result from \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} where the above mentioned CR transport
properties, neglected in the \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} simulations for
simplicity, are modeled. In this way we want to obtain a model able to predict
the radio and gamma-ray emission and to reproduce the main observed RH
proprieties.

Following closely \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}, when turbulent advection completely dominates the CR profile, this can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
C_{\rm{simple}}(R) = C_{0} \left( \frac{P(R)}{P_{0}} \right)^{\frac{\beta_{\rm{CR}}}{\gamma}} \, ,
\label{eq:Csimple}
\end{equation} 

where $\beta_{\rm{CR}}=(\alpha+2)/3$, $\gamma=5/3$ and $P(R)=n_{\rm{e}}(R) k_{\rm{B}} T(R)$ is the pressure. However, as explained before, both propagation and advection shape the CR profile and the ratio of their transport coefficients determines the exact shape. The treatment of this case is analytically developed in \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} by solving the continuity equation for the CR density profile $\rho_{\rm{CR}}$. They found

\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm{CR}}(R) = \rho_{\rm{CR},0} \left( \frac{P(R)}{P_{0}} \right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} \rmn{exp} \left( \frac{R}{R_{*}} \right) \, ,
\label{eg:rhoCR}
\end{equation} 

where $R_{*}=\gamma_{\rm{\rm{tu}}}R_{\rm{c}}$, $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ is the turbulent parameter, and $R_{\rm{c}}$ is a characteristic radius where the turbulence is supposed to be injected which should be comparable to the clusters core radius. Assuming for simplicity that $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rm{e}}(R)/n_{0}$, so neglecting the temperature dependence, and a standard $\beta$-profile for the electron density as

\begin{equation}
n_{\rm{e}} = n_{0} \left( 1+\frac{R^{2}}{R_{\rm{c}}^{2}} \right)^{-\frac{3\beta_{\rm{cl}}}{2}} \, ,
\label{eq:beta_profile}
\end{equation} 

the CR density profile $C_{\rm{transport}}(R)=C_{0}(\rho_{\rm{CR}}(R)/\rho_{\rm{CR},0})^{\beta_{\rm{CR}}}$ finally results to be

\begin{equation}
C_{\rm{transport}}(R) = C_{0}\left( 1+ \frac{R^{2}}{R_{C}^{2}} \right)^{-\beta_{\rm{c}}} \rmn{exp}\left( {\frac{R}{R_{*}}\beta_{\rm{CR}}} \right)
\label{eq:Ctransport}
\end{equation} 

for $R_{-}<R<R_{+}$, where $\beta_{\rm{c}}=3\beta_{\rm{cl}}~\beta_{\rm{CR}}/2\gamma$, while $C_{\rm{transport}}(R) = C_{\rm{transport}}(R_{\pm})$ for $R<R_{-}$ and $R>R_{+}$ respectively. The solution for these radii is

\begin{equation}
R_{\pm} = \frac{3\beta_{\rm{cl}}}{2\gamma}R_{*}\left(1\pm\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{2R_{\rm{c}}\gamma}{3\beta_{\rm{cl}}R_{*}}\right)^{2}}\right) \, .
\label{eq:Rpm}
\end{equation} 

Therefore, changing the value of the transport parameter $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$, we can mimic different CR transport cases in the cluster; for high $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ we fall in the advection-dominated \emph{simple} case while in case $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}\approx1$ the CR profile is flat. We show this in Appendix~\ref{app:B} for the two representative NCCC Coma and CCC Perseus cases, where we also show the result in case $C(R)=C_{\rm{semi-analytical}}(R)=\tilde{C}(R)\rho_{\rm{gas}}(R)/m_{\rm{p}}$ with $\tilde{C}(R)$ the mass-dependent universal normalization CR profile found in cosmological simulations of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. As expected, the CR profile driven by simulations is characterized by a more centrally peaked profile with respect to the analytical case. Note also that the Perseus profile is much more centrally peaked with respect to Coma, which reflects their CCC and NCCC classification respectively.

The following steps are to i) generalize  the above approach for our GNFW gas profiles obtained in Section~\ref{sec:2.2}, and ii) merge the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} analytical approach with the $\tilde{C}$ universal CR normalization obtained from simulations in order to get a mass-scaling for our CR profiles. As explained in Appendix~\ref{app:B}, in this case there is not an exact solution for the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} treatment of the problem. In fact, when trying to solve it analytically, one ends up with a 5-order equation. It is not practical to solve numerically such equation, and at the same time to discharge the unphysical solution, for our more than $10^4$ halos. For simplicity, we will proceed with the approximation of using the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} formalism, after some modifications in order to adapt it to our case (see Appendix~\ref{app:B}). Therefore, we now construct our final hybrid CR model. We have

\begin{equation}
C_{\rm{simple}}(R)=C_{0} \left( \frac{P(R)}{P_{0}} \right)^{\frac{\beta_{\rm{CR}}}{\gamma}} = C_{0} \left( \eta(R) \right)^{\beta_{\rm{CR}}},
\label{eq:Csimple_1}
\end{equation} 

where we introduced the advective CR profile $\eta(R)=(P(R)/P(0))^{1/\gamma}$ (see \citealp{2011A&A...527A..99E} for details). We can rewrite $\rho_{\rm{CR}}$ as

\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm{CR}}(R) = \rho_{CR,0} \eta(R) \rmn{exp} \left( \frac{R}{R_{*}} \right) \, .
\label{eg:rhoCR_1}
\end{equation} 

Now we introduce the \emph{semi-analytical} mass-dependent universal normalization CR profile of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} in the following way

\begin{equation}
\eta(R) = \left( \frac{C_{\rm{simple}}(R)}{C_0} \right)^{1/\beta_{\rm{CR}}} = \left( \frac{C_{\rm{final}}(R)}{C_0} \right)^{1/\beta_{\rm{CR}}} \, ,
\label{eq:eta}
\end{equation}

\caption{In the left panel, our final model $C_{\rm{final}}$ is shown for the NCCC and CCC cases and for different values of $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$. We normalize $C_{\rm{final}}$ to $C_{0}=C(0,\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100)$ where we fix the CR populations to have a constant total CR number as in Equation~(36) of \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} integrating up $R_{200}$. In the right panel, we compare the $C_{\rm{final}}$ and pure semi-analytical cases (plugging in our GNFW gas profiles plus the temperature outer decrease) with the analytical GNFW case (with $\alpha=2.3$) for $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100$. Here, the CR profiles are normalized to $C_{0.1}=C(0.1R_{200})$.}
\label{fig:CRFinalModel}
\end{figure*}

where we redefine $C_{\rm{simple}}(R)$ as $C_{\rm{final}}(R) = \tilde{C}(R) P(R) $ of our hybrid model, where $\tilde{C}(R)$ is the normalization CR profile of Equation~(22) of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}, and $P(R) = n_{\rm{e}}(R) k_{\rm{B}} T(R)$. Here $T(R)$ represents the decline toward the cluster periphery expected by the fit to the universal temperature profile derived from cosmological cluster simulations \citep{2007MNRAS.378..385P,2010MNRAS.409..449P}. The last step is to generalize the case with one CR population with spectral index $\alpha$, used up to here, to the case of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} where three different CR populations $\alpha_{i}=(2.15,2.3,2.55)$ are adopted. The whole formalism is easily extended to the three CR populations case by using sums over the three spectral indexes (see \citealp{2010MNRAS.409..449P}). This extension enters in the $A_{\nu}$ calculation, the $(\epsilon_{\rm{B}}(R)/\epsilon_{B_{\rm{c}}})^{(\alpha-2)/4}$ factor of Equation~(\ref{eq:jnu}), and into Equation~(\ref{eq:Csimple_1}). While for the first two cases there are no problems, the latter would be. In fact, introducing a sum over $\alpha_{i}$ in Equation~(\ref{eq:Csimple_1}) would make impossible to analytically reverse it to get $\eta(R)$ of Equation~(\ref{eq:eta}). We decide to not introduce the three CR spectral indexes in this part and just use $\alpha = 2.3$ into Equation~(\ref{eq:Ctransport}).\footnote[9]{We check that the choice of $\alpha$ into Equation~(\ref{eq:Ctransport}) does not affect the result. Varying $\alpha$ within $2.15-2.55$ leaves the radial shape and the normalization unchanged within $0.5\%$.} We however extend to three CR spectral indexes the $A_{\nu}$ and $(\epsilon_{\rm{B}}(R)/\epsilon_{B_{\rm{c}}})^{(\alpha-2)/4}$ factors (see Appendix~\ref{app:A}). In this way, when $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ is high enough, e.g. 100 (1000), we recover the radial shape and normalization of the semi-analytical model of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} at a $1\%$ ($0.1\%$) level.

We therefore end up with a new $C_{\rm{transport}}$, which now we shall call $C_{\rm{final}}$, with all the needed ingredients, i.e.~a mass-scaling CR normalization for our simulation derived cluster population, the general REXCESS derived GNFW gas profiles, the universal outer temperature decline and, least but not last, the $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ parameter which allows us to explore different turbulent states of the clusters in our MultiDark sample.\footnote[10]{In our final model, $R_{\rm{c}}$ of Equation~(\ref{eq:Rpm}) becomes the characteristic radius of our GNFW gas profile of Section~\ref{sec:2.2}, i.e.~$R_{\rm{c}}=0.2\times R_{500}$, and $\beta_{\rm{cl}}=0.8$ (changing the value of $\beta_{\rm{cl}}$ between e.g. 0.4 and 1.2 has no impact at all).}

In Figure~\ref{fig:CRFinalModel}, left panel, we show $C_{\rm{final}}$ for the NCCC and CCC cases for different values of the $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ parameter. Additionally, in the right panel, we compare our final model with the analytical GNFW exact solution (see Appendix~\ref{app:B}) and the pure semi-analytical cases for $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100$ and normalized at $0.1 \times R_{200}$. As mentioned above, for high $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ values, we recover the shape and normalization of the semi-analytical model of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. Note therefore the more centrally peaked profile of our final model with respect to the analytical GNFW case. Indeed, the choice to introduce in our model $\tilde{C}$ from the \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} simulations may introduce an overcooling problem. This can however be easily counteracted by changing the $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ and $\alpha_B$ values. The risk is that, when modeling a galaxy cluster, the final $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ value will be biased as the CR transport effects are degenerate with the initial CR profile, the $\alpha_B$ value, and other possible effects that we are not considering here as e.g.~cluster asphericity (see also next Section~\ref{sec:3}).

\section{Radio Surface Brightness Modeling}
\label{sec:3}
In this Section we apply our model to reproduce the RHs characteristics of some galaxy clusters. Our final model includes a normalization parameter $g_{\rm{CR}}$ which 
acts just as a linear scaling for the emission and can be included in the calculation substituting $A_{\nu}$ with $A_{\nu,\rm{final}}=g_{\rm{CR}}A_{\nu}$ (see Appendix~\ref{app:A}). Note that this parameter can be interpreted as the \emph{maximum CR acceleration efficiency parameter} $g(\zeta_{\rm{p,max}})$ of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} \emph{only} when $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}\approx100$. We will additionally make use of the CR-to-thermal pressure $X_{\rm{CR}}=P_{\rm{CR}}/P_{\rm{th}}$.\footnote[11]{The CR pressure isay $P_{\rm{CR}}=\frac{g_{\rm{CR}} C_{\rm{final}} m_{\rm{p}} c^{2}}{6} \Sigma_{i=1}^{3} \Delta_{i} \beta_{1/(1+q^2)}  \left( \frac{\alpha_{i}-1}{2},\frac{3-\alpha_{i}}{2} \right)$, where $c$ is the speed of light, $q=0.8$ \citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P} and $\Delta_{i} = (0.767, 0.143, 0.0975)$ are the normalization factors found by \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} (see also Appendix~\ref{app:A}). The thermal pressure is $P_{\rm{th}}=n_{\rm{gas}}k_{\rm{B}}T$.} 

We take as example four galaxy clusters. The giant radio halos of Coma \citep{1997A&A...321...55D} and Abell~2163 \citep{2001A&A...373..106F,2009A&A...499..679M} both merging NCCCs, and the radio-mini halos of Perseus \citep{1990MNRAS.246..477P} and Ophiuchus \citep{2009A&A...499..371G,2009A&A...499..679M} both non-merging CCCs. The radio emission of these clusters is representative of a wide class of RHs and, additionally, Perseus, Ophiuchus and Coma are among the most promising clusters for gamma-ray observations \citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P,2011arXiv1105.3240P}. In Table~\ref{tab:RadioHalos}, we summarize the main characteristics of these halos and we detail the main parameters adopted for the modeling and the corresponding results. In Figure~\ref{fig:SBmodeling}, we show the corresponding surface brightness and CR-to-thermal pressure. Note that we model these clusters at 1.4~GHz and within $R_{200}$.

Top rows are giant radio halos, while the bottom are mini-halos. $\Delta d$ represents the approximate diameter of the RH. $L_{1.4~\rm{GHz},~\rm{obs}}$ is the total luminosity at 1.4~GHz. $M_{200}$ and $R_{200}$ are taken from \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R}.

For Perseus, we take $\rho_{\rm{gas}}$ from \cite{2003ApJ...590..225C} and the temperature central dip is modeled as in \cite{2004A&A...413...17P}. For all clusters, we also adopt the outer temperature decrease. Note that despite the fact that Ophiuchus is a CCC and has a central temperature dip, we adopt a constant temperature in the central part because the dip is important only below $30$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~kpc (see \citealp{2010MNRAS.405.1624M}) and therefore it is not critical for the surface brightness modeling. The Fit Parameters column indicates the best fit values (top) and other permitted values for the modeling (bottom), and $L_{1.4~\rm{GHz},~\rm{model}}$ is the corresponding predicted total luminosity at 1.4~GHz within $R_{200}$.

The Coma giant radio halo has a morphology remarkably similar to the extended X-ray thermal bremsstrahlung emission, although the radio peak seems to be displaced by about $0.05$~deg with respect to the X-ray one and the radio emission declines more slowly going toward the cluster outskirts \citep{1992A&A...259L..31B,1997A&A...321...55D}. Note that it is clearly non-spherical, showing an elongation in the East-West direction. The full width half maximum (FWHM) of the \cite{1997A&A...321...55D} radio observation beam is $0.156$~deg, so almost two orders of magnitude larger than the X-ray observation of \cite{1992A&A...259L..31B}.\footnote[12]{Note therefore that the difference in position of the radio and X-ray peaks is negligible for the modeling.}
%The \cite{1992A&A...259L..31B} X-ray observations were performed with the ROSAT satellite which had a resolution between $0.0028$ and $0.008$~deg depending on the pointing mode. The full width half maximum (FWHM) of the \cite{1997A&A...321...55D} radio observation beam was $0.156$~deg, so almost two orders of magnitude larger than the X-ray observation\footnote[12]{Note therefore that the difference in position of the radio and X-ray peaks is negligible for the modeling.}. This can of course have a critical impact on the modeling. 
We therefore apply a Gaussian smoothing to our theoretical surface brightness of Equation~(\ref{eq:lum}) with $\sigma_{\rm{smoothing}} = FWHM_{\rm{radio}}/2.355$. 
We investigate different values of $\alpha_{\rm{B}}=(0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7)$ and of the $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ parameter from 1 to 100.\footnote[13]{We fix the CR number for $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100$ using Equation~(36) of \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}, integrating up $R_{200}$, and then we oblige the CR number to be the same at lower $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ values.} We fix the central magnetic field $B_{0}=5$~$\mu$G \citep{2010A&A...513A..30B} and we use $g_{\rm{CR}}$ as normalization factor to match the radio observations. The best fit to the data is obtained for $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=1$ and $\alpha_{\rm{B}}=0.6$, however, values as high as $\gamma_{\rm{tu}} \approx 4$ can be accommodated. We recover the radio surface brightness shape and the total radio luminosity within about $20\%$. The gamma-ray flux (see Appendix~\ref{app:C}) within $R_{200}$ for the best fit case and for energies above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is $F_{\gamma} = 4.1 \times 10^{-9}$ ($1.5 \times 10^{-12}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The $\gamma_{\rm{tu}} = 1$ case is therefore in tension with the limit recently set by \emph{Fermi}-LAT \citep{2012AAS...21920701Z} of $F_{\gamma, UL} (>100~\rm{MeV}) \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. Note that using a slightly higher $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ value, the prediction becomes again in agreement with gamma-ray observations. In fact, for $\gamma_{\rm{tu}} = 4$ and $\alpha_{\rm{B}}=0.3$ one obtains $F_{\gamma} (>100~\rm{MeV}) = 9.6 \times 10^{-10}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ (and $F_{\gamma} (>100~\rm{GeV}) = 3.6 \times 10^{-13}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$). 

The Abell~2164 giant radio halo is also closely correlated to the cluster thermal X-ray structure showing a slower decline going toward the cluster outskirts with respect to the bremsstrahlung emission \citep{2001A&A...373..106F}. It also appears to be non-spherical, being its shape elongated in the East-West direction. 
%The radio observations of \cite{2001A&A...373..106F} were performed with the Very Large Array (VLA) with a corresponding synthesized beam of $45$''$\times60$'' at 1.4 ~GHz. 
We use the surface brightness provided in \cite{2009A&A...499..679M} where the radio image has a circular Gaussian beam with $FWHM_{\rm{radio}}=62$"=$0.017$~deg. The position of radio and X-ray peaks is displaced by about 19'' and Matteo Murgia has kindly provided the radio surface brightness computed with respect to the \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R} X-ray position (however, it is almost unchanged). The $FWHM_{\rm{radio}}$ is larger than the resolution of the ROSAT satellite from which we take the gas density. Once converted the angular sizes to physical sizes, the corresponding $\sigma_{\rm{smoothing}}$ is of the order of the Coma one because of the high distance of Abell~2163. Therefore, we apply the Gaussian smoothing also in this case. 
%
We follow the same procedure as in Coma, using again $B_{0}=5$~$\mu$G. The best fit to the data, and also the only acceptable one, is obtained for $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=1$ and $\alpha_B=0.3$, i.e.~the flattest possible surface brightness. We recover the emission shape and the total luminosity within about $15\%$. The corresponding gamma-ray flux within $R_{200}$ for energies above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is $F_{\gamma} = 4.2 \times 10^{-10}$ ($1.5 \times 10^{-13}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$, about two orders of magnitude lower than the upper limit obtained by \emph{Fermi}-LAT \citep{2010ApJ...717L..71A}.

The Perseus diffuse radio emission is the best known example of radio-mini halo \citep{1990MNRAS.246..477P} and Perseus itself is surely one of the best studied clusters in X-rays (e.g.~\citealp{2003ApJ...590..225C,2006MNRAS.366..417F,2011arXiv1105.5025F}). Also in the Perseus case, clear similarities between radio and thermal X-ray structures are found. We proceed as before but now adopting $B_{0}=10$~$\mu$G (see \citealp{2010ApJ...710..634A,2011arXiv1111.5544M} for a discussion on the Perseus magnetic field). The best fit to the data is obtained for $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=3$ and $\alpha_{\rm{B}}=0.4$, however, values as high as $\gamma_{\rm{tu}} \approx 100$, and as low as $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=2$, can be easily accommodated. We recover the surface brightness shape and the total luminosity within about $10\%$. The gamma-ray flux within $R_{200}$ for the best fit case and for energies above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is $F_{\gamma} = 1.4 \times 10^{-8}$ ($5.1 \times 10^{-12}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. Adopting $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100$ and $\alpha_B=0.3$, the corresponding gamma-ray flux above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is $F_{\gamma} = 4.9 \times 10^{-9}$ ($1.8 \times 10^{-12}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. Note that the central galaxy NGC~1275 flux above 100~MeV measured by \emph{Fermi} is of about $2 \times 10^{-7}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ \citep{2009arXiv0904.1904T}, well above our predictions that however refer to the whole cluster. We can compare these predictions with the upper limit above 1~TeV, and for a region within $0.15$~deg around the cluster center, recently obtained by \cite{2011arXiv1111.5544M}. For the $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=3$ ($\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100$) case, we obtain a flux of $F_{\gamma}(>1~\rm{TeV},<0.15~\rm{deg}) = 7.3 \times 10^{-14}$ ($5.5 \times 10^{-14}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$, which is well below the MAGIC collaboration upper limit of $F_{\gamma,\rm{UL}}(>1~\rm{TeV},<0.15~\rm{deg}) \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-13}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. Note also that, in the case of $\gamma_{\rm{tu}} = 100$, we obtain a maximum CR acceleration efficiency parameter of $0.52$, about half of the value adopted by \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} (we do not obtain the same luminosities predicted by \citealp{2010MNRAS.409..449P} because they do not use the temperature central dip and outer decrease).

The Ophiuchus cluster has been widely studied both in radio and X-rays in the last few years because of a claim of presence of a non-thermal hard X-ray tail \citep{2008A&A...479...27E,2008PASJ...60.1133F,2009A&A...499..371G,2009A&A...499..679M,2009MNRAS.396.2237P,2009A&A...508.1161N,2010A&A...514A..76M,2010MNRAS.405.1624M}. 
It was classified as a merging cluster by \cite{2001PASJ...53..605W}, but more recently \cite{2008PASJ...60.1133F} did not found any evidence of merging and, on the contrary, classified it as one of the hottest clusters with a  cool-core (see also \citealp{2010MNRAS.405.1624M}). Its radio mini-halo displays similarities with the thermal X-ray emission. For our modeling we use the surface brightness provided by \cite{2009A&A...499..679M}. The position of radio and X-ray peaks seems displaced by about 24''. Again, Matteo Murgia has kindly provided the radio surface brightness computed with respect to the \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R} X-ray position, however the change is not very significant. 
We proceed as before, adopting a central magnetic field value of $B_{0}=10$~$\mu$G. The best fit to the data is obtained for $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=5$ and $\alpha_B=0.7$, however, values as high as $\gamma_{\rm{tu}} \approx 100$, and as low as $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=2$, can be easily accommodated. We recover the surface brightness shape and the total luminosity within about $20\%$. The gamma-ray flux within $R_{200}$ for the best fit case and for energies above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is $F_{\gamma} = 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$ ($4.3 \times 10^{-14}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. Adopting $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100$ and $\alpha_B=0.3$, the corresponding gamma-ray flux above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is $F_{\gamma} = 8.3 \times 10^{-11}$ ($3.1 \times 10^{-14}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The gamma-ray flux is, in both cases, about two orders of magnitude lower than the upper limit obtained by \emph{Fermi}-LAT \citep{2010ApJ...717L..71A}. Note also that in the case of $\gamma_{\rm{tu}} = 100$ we obtain a maximum CR acceleration efficiency parameter of $0.014$. 

We want to stress the following points:

\begin{enumerate} 
 \item The model parameter space for Coma and Abell~1263 giant halos is much more reduced than for the mini-halos cases. 
       In fact, very low $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ values are needed in order to get acceptable fits.
       We would expect higher $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ values for the merging NCCCs \citep{2011A&A...527A..99E}.
       However, there are three main factors that render the merging NCCC fits not conclusive and can alleviate this problem. 
       i) Primary electrons accelerated in outer shocks, which we do not consider, could have an important contribution in the RH emission, particularly in the cluster outskirts.
       ii) We are making the approximation to consider these clusters spherical symmetric, which is clearly not the case.
       Finally, iii) adopting the simulation-driven $\tilde{C}$ from \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} in our hybrid model, 
       we may be adopting a too steep central CR normalization which result in lower required $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ values with respect to a 
       flatter choice. To test this last point, we fit the Coma surface brightness using a model without $\tilde{C}$ obtaining  
       that values as high as $\gamma_{\rm{tu}} \approx 8$ can be accommodated. However, the $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=1$ case 
       still represents the best fit model, it is indeed not affected by such arguments as the CR profile is always flat in this case. 
       Despite these issues, we can reproduce the Coma and Abell~2163 RHs fairly well, solving the previous problems of 
       the \emph{classical} hadronic model (see e.g.~\citealp{2010MNRAS.401...47D}). 
 \item RHs measurements set more stringent constraints on our hadronic model than gamma-ray observations, apart for the Coma case.
       Gamma-ray observations are a fundamental tool to disentangle between the hadronic and re-acceleration model.
       However, gamma-ray predictions should be scaled down with respect to previous results \citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P,2011arXiv1105.3240P} 
       in light of the results presented here (see also \citealp{2011A&A...527A..99E}).
 \item The magnetic field values adopted here are perfectly in agreement with other observational constrains, solving previous tensions of the \emph{classical}
       hadronic model (see e.g.~\citealp{2011ApJ...728...53J}). Indeed, different $B_{0}$ values could be adopted without entering 
       in tension with other observational constraints with the exception of Coma for which a higher $B_{0}$ value would be in contradiction 
       with \cite{2010A&A...513A..30B}, while a lower one could result in a higher gamma-ray emission in 
       contrast with the \cite{2012AAS...21920701Z} limit.
 \item When considering the $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100$ case, plausible only for Perseus and Ophiuchus, the $g_{\rm{CR}}$ parameter can be interpreted as the maximum
       CR acceleration efficiency used in \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. This value should then be universal, i.e.~it should be the same in all clusters. We find 
       $g_{\rm{CR, Perseus}} = 0.52$ and $g_{\rm{CR, Ophiuchus}} = 0.014$, because we fixed $B_{0}=10$~$\mu$G in both cases and used $g_{\rm{CR}}$ 
       as normalization. This discrepancy can be easily solved by increasing/lowering the Perseus/Ophiuchus central magnetic field (e.g.~$B_{0,\rm{Perseus}}=20$~$\mu$G 
       and $B_{0,\rm{Ophiuchus}}=1$~$\mu$G). We note however that, at this stage, this is not conclusive as any $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ value can 
       virtually be chosen for both clusters. 
 \item With this reduced cluster sample, we cannot draw any definitive conclusion on the parameters used in the modeling as many different choices could be done on
       the magnetic field, the $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ and $\alpha_{\rm{B}}$ parameters. This is particularly true for the analyzed mini-halos, for which almost all the
       ($\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$, $\alpha_{\rm{B}}$) parameter space is available (note also that the $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ and $\alpha_{\rm{B}}$ variables are of course degenerate). 
       Such a study performed on all the knows RHs is highly desirable but beyond the scope of this work with which instead we 
       want to investigate the LOFAR cluster survey potentiality.
\end{enumerate}

The hadronic model built here reproduces the main characteristics of both giant and mini-halos without entering in tension with any existing observational constraint. As we will see in the next section, it can also reproduce the radio-to-X-ray scaling relation, solving the previous problems of the \emph{classical} hadronic model, and the radio-to-SZ scaling relation. It therefore fully accomplishes to our initial purposes.

\section{Radio Scaling Relations}
\label{sec:4}
An anticipated in the Introduction, there exist an apparent bimodality between the radio and X-ray cluster emission. Clusters with the same X-ray luminosity both host RHs and do not show any diffuse radio emission (e.g.~\citealp{2009A&A...507..661B,2011A&A...527A..99E}). More recently, a study of the radio-to-SZ scaling relation showed the absence of any kind of strong bimodality dividing the cluster population into radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters \citep{2012MNRAS.421L.112B}. In this section, we investigate these two scaling relations.

In Figure~\ref{fig:SR}, we show the general scaling relations of our final CR model of Section~\ref{sec:2.3} applied to the MultiDark sample. We show both the radio-to-X-ray  and the radio-to-SZ scaling relations varying different parameters as $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$, $B_{0}$, $\alpha_{\rm{B}}$ and the redshift. We fix the $g_{\rm{CR}}$-normalization parameter to 0.5 for all cases, ensuring an average CR-to-thermal pressure at $2\%$-level ($0.05\%$-level) within $R_{500}$ ($R_{500}/2$). Here, the radio luminosity is calculated at $1.4$~GHz within $R_{500}.$\footnote[14]{The mean (median) difference between calculating $L_{\nu}$ within $R_{200}$ or $R_{500}$ is 5.3\% (5.6\%).} In our CR model, we fix the CR number for $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100$ using Equation~(36) of \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}, integrating up $R_{500}$, and then we oblige the CR number to be the same at lower $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ values; this will be the case also in the following. Note in particular how the different parameters affect in different ways the NCCC and CCC populations for the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ and $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rm{SZ}}$ relations. This is mainly the result of the different dependence on gas density of $L_{\rm{X}}$ and $Y_{\rm{SZ}}$.

In order to compare our model prediction with observations, we select a particular realization of our model. We artificially, and randomly, divide our MultiDark $z=0.2$ sample (which well compares with the redshift of the observational samples, see below and Appendix~\ref{app:D}) in radio-quiet and radio-loud clusters, with the latter being $10\%$ of the total. We assign $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=1$ to all the radio-quiet cluster, and we assign randomly and uniformly distributed central magnetic fields $B_0$ in the intervals $[2.5,5.5]$~$\mu$G and $[5,10]$~$\mu$G for NCCCs and CCCs, respectively. For the radio-loud clusters, we assign randomly and uniformly $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ values in the intervals $[40,80]$ and $[1,5]$ for NCCCs and CCCs, respectively, and central magnetic field values in the intervals $[4.5,7.5]$~$\mu$G and $[7.5,12.5]$~$\mu$G for NCCCs and CCCs, respectively. We fix $\alpha_{\rm{B}}=0.5$ and $g_{\rm{CR}}=0.5$ for all the clusters; the latter choice ensures a median average CR-to-thermal pressure of about $2\%$ ($0.05\%$) within $R_{500}$ ($R_{500}/2$). Note that these choices are not driven by any consideration apart the need to reproduce observations. Indeed, we have no robust clues of which values should take these parameters in clusters, with possibly the only exception of the magnetic field. It is clear the need of large population studies of radio observed clusters in order to be able to draw robust hypothesis on the interplay of the different parameters in the modeling. In Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}, we show how our model compares with the observed radio-to-X-ray and radio-to-SZ scaling relations. Let us first comment on the two observational relations.
 
For the comparison to the observed 1.4~GHz radio-to-X-ray scaling relation, in Appendix~\ref{app:D} we construct the sample shown as black (halos) and red (mini-halos) crosses (plus some upper limits) in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}. This sample is obtained from \cite{2009A&A...507..661B}, \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E},  and \cite{2009A&A...499..371G} and has a median redshift of $z\approx0.18$. The corresponding observational scaling relation in the form of $\log_{10} L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}} = A + B~\log_{10} L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ has $A=-50.433\pm2.226$ and $B=1.803\pm0.049$, and a scatter of $\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.44$ (we do not include upper limits in the fit and units are as in Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}). We refer the reader to \cite{2009A&A...507..661B} and \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} for an extensive discussion on this topic. However, we would like to stress that, as interestingly noted also by \cite{2009A&A...499..679M}, in contrast with radio halos, mini-halos seem to span a wide range of radio luminosity. The Perseus mini-halo (Y-axis highest red cross in the left plot of Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}), for example, has a radio luminosity which is almost two order of magnitude higher than radio halos at the same X-ray luminosity. On the other hand, the Ophiuchus mini-halo (Y-axis lowest red cross in the left plot of Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}), which is a representative of other few such examples recently detected in CCCs (i.e.~A2029 and A1835), has a radio luminosity which is much lower, more typical of halos in merging clusters, and actually below the shown upper limits. Note also that the determination of the $L_{1.4}-L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ relation slope is not very robust because of the few known RHs and the uncertainties in the measurements both in the radio and X-rays. The recently detected mini-halos with very low luminosities are a clear example of the uncertainty and the large scatter that this relation may have. On the other hand, X-ray luminosities for the same object from e.g.~ROSAT and \emph{Chandra} can easily differ by a factor of few. In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}, we additionally show the \cite{2009JCAP...09..024K} slope prediction of $\approx1.2$, arbitrarily normalized for visual purposes, from their simple analytical hadronic model.

\label{fig:PLSZ}
\end{figure*}

For the comparison to the observed 1.4~GHz radio-to-SZ scaling relation, we take as reference the result obtained by \cite{2012MNRAS.421L.112B} with the sample of radio halos from \cite{2007MNRAS.378.1565C} (hereafter C07; median redshift of $z \approx 0.18$; note that no mini-halos are included). For this sample, \cite{2012MNRAS.421L.112B} quotes $Y_{\rm{SZ}}$ within the halo radii given by \cite{2007MNRAS.378.1565C}. These radii have a median of about $0.5$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~Mpc which well compares with our MultiDark $z = 0.2$ snapshot median $R_{500} \approx 0.4$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~Mpc. For the C07 sample, \cite{2012MNRAS.421L.112B} obtains a scaling relation in the form of  $\log_{10} L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}} = A + B~\log_{10} Y_{\rm{SZ}}$ with $A=29.7\pm0.8$ and $B=1.17\pm0.18$, and a scatter of $\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.28$ (units are as in Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}). We want to stress however that we do not consider this definitive, as for the radio-to-X-ray case, and these scaling relation determinations are likely going to be improved in the near future. 

We can now analyze Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}. The normalization of our model can be arbitrarily varied changing $g_{\rm{CR}}$ as long as the resulting $X_{\rm{CR}}$ respects the current observational constraints (e.g.~\citealp{2011arXiv1111.5544M}) and remains below few percents. As explained above, our choice of $g_{CR}=0.5$ ensures average CR-to-thermal pressures at $2\%$-level within $R_{500}$, and therefore the available parameter space is quite wide. Our model can both mimic a cluster radio bimodality or not depending on the parameters adopted for the two artificial radio-loud and radio-quiet populations. However, we note that, with the choices of Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}, the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ radio-loud and quiet population difference is larger than the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rm{SZ}}$ one which exhibits more a sort of continuum going from the radio-loud CCCs to the radio-quiet NCCCs. This is because $L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ scales as $\rho_{\rm{gas}}^2$ while $Y_{\rm{SZ}}$ as $\rho_{\rm{gas}}$. As a consequence, the highly peaked gas profiles of CCCs have less impact on $Y_{\rm{SZ}}$ than on  $L_{\rm{X,bol}}$. This can mimic the observed discrepancy of the presence of a bimodality in $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ and the absence of it in $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rm{SZ}}$. Regarding the slope of our model, it is difficult to give a definitive determination because, again, this depends on the parameter values adopted and, particularly, to relative difference introduced between the NCCC/CCC and the radio-loud/quiet populations. However, we note that our $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ is slightly shallower than the observed relation, more similar to the \cite{2009JCAP...09..024K} prediction, and that our $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rm{SZ}}$ slope compares quite well with the observed one. Due to the many uncertainties and lack of robustness both in the observations and modeling at this stage, we do not attempt to additionally fine-tune our model to observations.

\section{Radio Luminosity Function}
\label{sec:5}

\caption{Radio Luminosity Function at 1.4~GHz. The top left panel shows the prediction of our final CR model (see main text for the details of the chosen parameters) for different percent of radio-loud clusters. Additionally shown is how the RLF builds up from the quiet and loud populations for the $25\%$ and $1\%$ cases. The top right panel shows the result obtained applying the observed $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ directly to the MultiDark mass function at  $z = 0.2$, using the $L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ of each halo as obtained from our phenomenological model, for different percent of radio-loud clusters.

The bottom right panel shows the comparison between the three approaches for 10\% of radio-loud clusters. The NVSS survey RLF \citep{1999NewA....4..141G} is also shown in all panels. Horizontal error bars represent the mass bins while the vertical error bars are Poissonian uncertainties. The light gray line with arrow shows the value above which the the RLF can be considered not affected by the low-luminosity decrease tail produced by the adopted mass cut (see Section~\ref{sec:2}) and the scatter in the halo luminosities.}
\label{fig:RLF_1.4}
\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4}, we show the radio luminosity function (RLF) at 1.4~GHz obtained from the representative realization of our final CR model, detailed in the previous section, and compare it with observational results. As for the X-ray emission, the RLF is completely determined by the cluster mass function and the radio luminosity-to-mass relation, through $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{ \rm{X,bol}}$ or $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rm{SZ}}$ with the additional uncertainty of the fraction of radio-loud clusters. Therefore, in Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4}, we also show the ``true'' RLFs obtained applying  the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ and $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rm{SZ}}$ relations to our MultiDark $z = 0.2$ snapshot using their $L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ and $Y_{\rm{SZ}, 500}$, as obtained from our phenomenological model, respectively. Pay attention that this is done using \emph{only} the halos defined as radio-loud clusters, not all of them, and we show the cases for 100\%, 25\%, 10\%, 5\% and 1\% radio-loud clusters. As clear from Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4}, this is different from what is obtained with our model, where a fraction of radio-loud cluster is indeed defined, but the radio-quiet population is also contributing to the RLF, dominating at low luminosities. In fact, the top left plot of Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4} also shows how our RLF builds up from the quiet and loud populations for the $25\%$ and $1\%$ radio-loud cases.

In Appendix~\ref{app:D}, we make an attempt to construct a RLF from existing X-ray flux-limited radio surveys. There exist two such studies, the cluster radio survey done with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) sky survey (NVSS) at $1.4$~GHz of \cite{1999NewA....4..141G} and the one done with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at $610$~MHz by \cite{VenturiGMRT_1,VenturiGMRT_2}. For the latter, one can also construct a RLF at 1.4~GHz using the corresponding RHs follow-up measurements. The fractions of radio-loud clusters are about 6\%, 18\% and 24\% for the NVSS 1.4~GHz, GMRT 610~MHz and GMRT 1.4~GHz samples, respectively. As explained in Appendix~\ref{app:D}, we use the 1.4~GHz NVSS RLF (with a median redshift of $z \approx 0.18$) as reference for our comparisons with observation. Note that the observational RLF determination is not very robust at this stage; the very different percent of radio-loud clusters found in different studies is indeed 
an indicator of this.

The right panels show the comparison of the RLF fits (top) and the cumulative number density of the MultiDark samples (bottom) to the result obtained with the analytical model. The bottom panels of these two plots show the relative differences as $\Delta n / n = (n_{\rmn{analytical}} - n_{\rmn{fit}})/n_{\rmn{fit}}$.

\label{fig:RLF_120}
\end{figure*} 
 
There is a general good agreement between the NVSS survey result and both our RLF and the ``true'' RLFs, particularly for fraction of radio-loud clusters between 10\% and 1\%. The larger discrepancy seems to be present in the RLF obtained from the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rm{X,bol}}$ where the  observed relation scatter is producing a high luminosity tail of objects contradicting the NVSS result. On the other side, the RLF obtained from the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rm{SZ}}$ seems the one better matching the NVSS result. 
Note however that both facts may be artifacts due to the interplay of the two relation scatter and the still small statistic of our MultiDark $z = 0.2$ snapshot at very high masses. Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4} shows that it will be difficult to discriminate between different scenarios at high radio luminosities (or masses). Indeed, the bottom right plot of Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4}, where we compare our RLF and the ``true'' RLFs at 10\% radio-loud cluster fraction, suggests that the lower luminosity (mass) clusters will be the most useful in disentangling between different models. It is clear the key role of the upcoming LOFAR cluster survey for which we present predictions in the following. Note also the clear low-luminosity decrease in the RLFs that is an artifact due to the adopted mass cut (see Section~\ref{sec:2}) and the scatter in the halo luminosities.

In Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120}, we show the predictions at 120~MHz obtained with the representative realization of our model, detailed in the previous section, with 10\% of radio-loud clusters. We show both the RLF (top left panel) and the cumulative number density (bottom left panel) at the different MultiDark snapshots of Table~1. Additionally shown is the expected LOFAR Tier~1 \emph{point-source} flux limit of $F_{5\sigma}^{\rmn{PS}}=0.5$~mJy \citep{2012JApA..tmp...34R} converted to a luminosity limit at a given redshift. This flux limit is clearly underestimated for nearby RHs which extension in the sky can be as high as e.g.~1~deg in the Coma cluster case. In order to make more reliable predictions, in the following, we will calculate the RH flux limit with the Equation~(10) of \cite{2010A&A...509A..68C} taking $R_{500}$ as halo extension and requiring the mean flux within the RH half-radius to be higher than $F_{5\sigma}^{\rmn{PS}}$. This may result in an overestimation of the flux limit for CCCs, which radio emission is more centrally concentrated than NCCCs. The median $R_{500}$ of our sample is about $0.4$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~Mpc at all redshifts. This translates to a flux limit of about $30$~mJy at $z = 0.1$, $7$~mJy at $z = 0.2$ and $0.5$~mJy, as the point-source value, at $z \approx 0.6$.

The lower flux limit is taken to be $F_{5\sigma}^{\rmn{PS}}=0.5$~mJy.
See main text for details.
}
\label{fig:RLF_120_flux}
\end{figure*}

In order to make a more quantitative prediction, we build an analytical model to describe the evolving RLF. We fit the 120~MHz RLF at different redshifts as a 2-order polynomial function in the form of $\log_{10} \rmn{d}n/\rmn{d}L_{120~\rmn{MHz}} = A_{1} + A_{2}~\log_{10} L_{120~\rmn{MHz}} + A_{3}~(\log_{10} L_{120~\rmn{MHz}})^{2}$ (only luminosities higher then $\log_{10} L_{120~\rmn{120MHz}} \geq 29.25$ are used in order to exclude the artificial low-luminosity decrease). We then obtain an analytical form for the dependence of the three parameters $A_{i}$ with respect to the redshift as $A_{i} = A_{i,0} + A_{i,1}~(1+z)$.\footnote[15]{The values of these parameters are $A_{1,0} = -436.79$, $A_{1,1} = 109.75$, $B_{1,0} = 29.68$, $B_{1,1} = -7.17$, $C_{1,0} = -0.51$ and $C_{1,1}$ = 0.12, and units are as the top left plot of Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120}.} In the right panels of Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120}, we compare the RLF fits (top) and the cumulative number density (bottom) to the result obtained with the derived analytical model. The results obtained with the latter well compare with the prediction at a given redshift showing a significant deviation only at very high luminosities, and at very low luminosities for the highest considered redshifts, where however the very small statistic significantly affects the result. 

This analytical model describing $\rmn{d}N^2(L,z)/\rmn{d}V_{\rmn{C}}\rmn{d}L$, where $V_{\rmn{C}}$ is the comoving volume, is then used to calculate the total cumulative number of RHs in the sky above a given flux value $F$ as
%
\begin{equation}
N(>F)  =  \int_{z_1}^{z_2} \rmn{d}z \frac{\rmn{d}V_{\rmn{C}}}{\rmn{d}z} \int_{L(F)}^{\infty} \frac{\rmn{d}N^2(L,z)}{\rmn{d}V_{\rmn{C}}\rmn{d}L} \rmn{d}L \, ,
\label{eq:NtotRH}
\end{equation}
%
where $L(F) = 4 \pi D(z)^2 F$ and $D(z)$ is the luminosity distance computed from the corresponding redshift $z$.
The result is shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120_flux}. We show the particular realization of our model described in the previous section with 10\% fraction of radio-loud clusters (black solid thick line; only luminosities above $\log_{10} L_{120~\rmn{120MHz}} \geq 29.25$ are integrated). The total is obtained integrating up to $z_{2} = 2$ as above this value only few clusters survive our mass cut and none would be detectable. The lower redshift limit (indicated as 0 in Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120_flux}) is $z_{1} = 0.018$ as the closer known RH, i.e.~Perseus. We also show how the total result builds up in different redshift bins. We contrast this with the RH total cumulative number obtained using \emph{only} the 10\% radio-loud clusters (black dashed thick line; this is done constructing the corresponding RLF and repeating the above steps to build an analytical model, where only luminosities above $\log_{10} L_{120~\rmn{120MHz}} \geq 30.75$ are integrated). 
%We additionally shown the two total results scaled down by a $50\%$ to roughly mimic an eventual RH redshift evolution as a consequence of a higher inverse Compton energy loss on the CMB for higher redshift (\citealp{2002A&A...396...83E}; this is somehow conservative as most of our cluster magnetic fields are comparable or higher than the CMB magnetic field). 

In the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120_flux}, we show the total number of RHs that would be \emph{detectable} by the LOFAR Tier~1 survey, where its sky coverage (about half sky) is taken into account. This is calculated with Equation~(\ref{eq:NtotRH}) taking $F = F_{\rmn{min}}$ where $F_{\rmn{min}}$ is calculated with the Equation~(10) of \cite{2010A&A...509A..68C} as explained above. The lower flux limit is taken to be $F_{5\sigma}^{\rmn{PS}}$, meaning that when $F_{\rmn{min}} < 0.5$~mJy, i.e.~at redshift above approximately $z = 0.6$, it is fixed at 0.5~mJy.  

LOFAR Tier~1 at 120~MHz should be able to detect a total of about $3500$ clusters hosting RHs above 0.5~mJy. The precise number is strongly dependent on the underling assumptions. There are two main uncertainties in our model: the fraction of radio-loud to radio-quiet clusters and the corresponding relative normalization (which in turn is the result of the interplay of the $\gamma_{\rmn{th}}$, $B_{0}$, $\alpha_{B}$, $g_{\rmn{CR}}$, and therefore $X_{CR}$, parameters). The first is relevant only at medium-high luminosities, as can be seen for the 1.4~GHz RLFs in Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120}, and therefore would not dramatically impact the total number of (detectable) RHs because this is dominated by the low luminosities. We asses the second uncertainty by comparing the total result of our model (black solid line) with the RLF obtained only from the radio-loud population (black dashed line). Their difference somehow shows the uncertainty in the modeling for a fixed fraction of radio-loud clusters as all the configuration between the solid and dashed lines can be virtually realized changing the relative normalization of the loud and quiet populations. 

The total number of (detectable) RHs is expected to be quite high. This is mainly due to neglecting an eventual mass-dependence in the model parameters and, more importantly, to the assumption that the model holds down to masses of about $M_{200}\approx1.4\times10^{14}$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}$ without any break. In fact, looking at the radio-to-X-ray and radio-to-SZ scaling relations of Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}, we can see that most of the RHs in our sample, also for the radio-loud population, lie at low masses and therefore at low luminosities unproved by current observations. The presence of a break at some low mass-scale, or some sort of mass-dependence in the model parameters causing a lowering of the RH luminosities, would eventually result in a dramatically reduced number of total (detectable) RHs. This would be more in agreement with recent predictions of a few to hundreds observable RHs by e.g.~\cite{2010A&A...509A..68C} and \cite{2011arXiv1110.2786S}, while \cite{2002A&A...396...83E} also found that thousands of RHs would be detectable by future surveys. However, current information do not permit to make any reliable assumption in this sense. 

Another relevant issue in such surveys is the identification of RHs and their hosting clusters (see also \citealp{2010A&A...509A..68C}). RHs constitute a small part of the entire radio source population and therefore need to be distinguished from the emission produced by other sources. A good approach in this sense is to use X-ray samples of galaxy clusters. This underlines the importance of the future eROSITA mission also for the cluster non-thermal emission study as it is expected to detect around $10^{5}$ clusters up to redshift $z \approx 1.3$ (see e.g.~\citealp{2011MSAIS..17..159C}).

Our results show the potentiality of the LOFAR survey, and other future radio instruments, in determining the (120~MHz) RLF properties in a very broad range of luminosities. In particular, it should permit a robust determination of the number of clusters hosting RHs at a given luminosity (mass). This will be extremely helpful in determining the parameter values for our hadronic model and eventually in elucidating the RH generation mechanism.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:6}
We present predictions for the RH population assuming that RHs are generated by secondaries of the hadronic CR interactions with the ICM. We construct a complete cosmological sample of galaxy clusters from the MultiDark N-body simulation \citep{2011arXiv1104.5130P} using seven snapshots from $z = 0$ up to $z = 1$. We select galaxy clusters imposing a low mass cut at $M_{200}\approx1.4\times10^{14}$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}$. 

We first construct a \emph{phenomenological} model, based on the observed REXCESS cluster gas profiles \citep{2008A&A...487..431C} and cluster mass-to-gas fraction relation \citep{2009ApJ...693.1142S}, which assigns a ICM gas density to a DM halo given only its total mass. In this way, we obtain a cosmological complete mock catalog of galaxy clusters matching the observed $L_{\rmn{X, bol}}$-to-mass, $Y_{\rmn{X}}$-to mass and $Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$-to-mass relations, and the X-ray luminosity function.

We then construct a new \emph{hybrid} hadronic model for the CR distribution in clusters. We merge previous results from simulations and analytical works. We adopt the semi-analytical mass-dependent universal normalization CR profile obtained from the hydrodynamic cluster cosmological simulations of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. We merge this with the analytical model of \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} which includes the treatment of CR transport processes. While CR advection tends to result in centrally enhanced CR profiles, the propagation in form of CR streaming and diffusion tends to produce flat CR profiles. The latter phenomena were not considered in previous works for sake of simplicity but turn out to be dramatically important. Note that the choice to adopt the \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} simulation-derived universal profile, providing a mass-scaling, may introduce an overcooling problem. This can be counteracted by changing the $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ and $\alpha_B$ values, governing the CR transport processes and the magnetic field radial decline, respectively. However, the risk is that, when modeling a given galaxy cluster, the final $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ value may be biased as the CR transport effects are degenerate with the initial CR profile, the $\alpha_B$ value, and other possible effects not considered here as cluster asphericity and the contribution of primary electrons accelerated in outer shocks. Additionally, by adopting the result of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}, which is parameterized with three CR spectral indexes $\alpha_{i}=(2.55,2.3,2.15)$, we are also neglecting the possible CR transport effects on the CR spectral index (see \citealp{2011A&A...527A..99E} for details). 

We model the Coma and Abell~2163 giant radio halos, and the Perseus and Ophiuchus radio mini-halos at 1.4~GHz. Our hybrid hadronic model can reproduce the surface brightness both of giant and mini-halos, solving problems of the \emph{classical} hadronic model, and we recover the total radio luminosity within maximum of 20\%. We do not find any tension with existing observations and constraints, particularly on magnetic field values. Note that radio measurements put stringent constraints than corresponding gamma-ray observations, with the exception of the Coma cluster case. Gamma-ray measurements are fundamental to disentangle between the hadronic and re-acceleration models. The results presented here show however that gamma-ray predictions should be scaled down with respect to previous works (e.g.~at least a factor of two for Perseus with respect to \citealp{2010MNRAS.409..449P}). Note in fact that the parameter space of the new hybrid hadronic model constructed here is largely extended with respect to previous models.

We then calculate the radio emission of the clusters of the mock catalog and show how different parameter choices in the CR modeling may affect the final result. We select a representative realization of our CR model and compare it with existing observations. Thanks to the inclusion of the CR transport phenomena, the hadronic model can now reproduce the apparent cluster bimodality observed in the radio-to-X-ray scaling relation \citep{2009A&A...507..661B,2011A&A...527A..99E}. At the same time, we can also reproduce the radio-to-SZ scaling relation recently presented by \cite{2012MNRAS.421L.112B} which does not show any evidence of bimodality. This discrepancy may be only apparent as we can reproduce both results.

We calculate the 1.4~GHz RLF and compare it with the observed one \citep{1999NewA....4..141G} finding a good agreement. The comparison between different RLFs illustrates that the low luminosity (mass) regime is the most promising range where to constrain different models by clearly determining the RH fraction against the total galaxy cluster population. We therefore calculate the 120~MHz RLF and cumulative number density, and make prediction for the LOFAR cluster survey. We compute the total cumulative number of RHs above a certain flux limit and show that, under our assumptions, we would expect LOFAR Tier~1 at 120~MHz to detect about ~3500 RHs above 0.5~mJy. The precise number is strongly dependent on the underling assumptions and, in particular, to the assumption that the model holds down to masses of about $M_{200}\approx1.4\times10^{14}$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}$ without any break. Most of the RHs in our sample lie at low masses and therefore at low luminosities unproved by current observations. The presence of a break at some low mass-scale, or some sort of mass-dependence in the model parameters causing a lowering of the RH luminosities, would eventually result in a dramatically reduced number of total (detectable) RHs. As the current available information do not permit to make any reliable assumption in this direction, we have to wait for the LOFAR results to shed light on this issue. 

We show the potentiality of observations by LOFAR, and other next-generation low-sensitivity radio instruments, in determining the RLF properties in a very broad range of luminosities. In particular, they should permit a robust determination of the number of clusters hosting RHs at a given luminosity (mass) and therefore elucidate the relation of the radio emission with cluster dynamical states in synergy with future X-ray missions like eROSITA. This will be extremely helpful in determining the parameter values for our hadronic model and eventually in elucidating the RH generation mechanism.

Concluding, we want to underline that thanks to our gas profile \emph{phenomenological} model and the new \emph{hybrid} hadronic model, we can provide cosmological complete multi-frequency cluster mock catalogs at different redshifts reproducing current observations. These can be used for different scientific purposes. We will make these catalogs, containing among others the $\rho_{\rmn{gas}}$, $L_{\rmn{X, bol}}$, $Y_{\rmn{X}}$, $Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$, $L_{120~\rmn{GHz}}$, $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}$ and $L_{\gamma}$ values, freely available on-line.

\section{Radio Emission Calculation}
\label{app:A}

The factor $A_{\nu}$ for the synchrotron radio luminosity calculation of Equation~(\ref{eq:jnu}) is:

\begin{equation}
A_{\nu} = A_{\rm{E_{synch}}} \frac{16^{2-\alpha_{\rm{e}}}\sigma_{\rm{pp}}m_{\rm{e}}c^{2}}{(\alpha_{\rm{e}}-2)\sigma_{\rm{T}}\epsilon_{B_{\rm{C}}}m_{\rm{p}}}\left(\frac{m_{\rm{p}}
}{m_{\rm{e}}}\right)^{\alpha_{\rm{e}}-2} \left(\frac{m_{\rm{e}}c^{2}}{\rmn{GeV}}\right)^{\alpha_{\rm{e}}-1} \, ,
\end{equation}

with:

\begin{equation}
A_{\rm{E_{synch}}} = \frac{\sqrt{3\pi}}{32\pi}\frac{B_{\rm{c}}e^{3}}{m_{\rm{e}}c^{2}}\frac{\alpha_{\rm{e}}+\frac{7}{3}}{\alpha_{\rm{e}}+1}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{3\alpha_{\rm{e}}-1}{12}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{3\alpha_{\rm{e}}+7}{12}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{\alpha_{\rm{e}}+5}{4}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{\alpha_{\rm{e}}+7}{4}\right)} \, ,
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_{\rm{e}}=\alpha+1$ and $\Gamma$ is the Gamma-function \citep{1965hmfw.book.....A}. $A_{\rm{E_{synch}}}$ is expressed in erg, and $A_{\nu}$ is expressed in erg~cm$^{3}$~g$^{-1}$~sr$^{-1}$. 
%The dimension of $A_{\rm{E_{synch}}}$ is [erg] if the electron charge $e$ is expressed in [ues], the electron mass $m_{\rm{e}}$ in [g], the speed of light $c$ in [cm/s] and the critical magnetic field value $B_{\rm{c}}$ in [G]. The dimension of $A_{\nu}$ is [erg~cm$^{3}$~g$^{-1}$~sr$^{-1}$] if the effective inelastic cross-section for proton-proton interactions $\sigma_{\rm{pp}} = 32~(0.96+\rm{e}^{4.42-2.4\alpha})$ and the Thomson cross-section $\sigma_{\rm{T}}$ are expressed in [mbarn], the first $m_{\rm{e}}$ in [g], the first $c$ in [cm/s], $B_{\rm{c}}$ of $\epsilon_{B_{\rm{C}}}$ is expressed in [G] and $m_{\rm{p}}$ in [g]. 
%Pay attention that here the $B_{C}$ value must be expressed in [G] to get the correct final units while in the main text it is expressed in [$\mu$G] because there it cancels out with the other magnetic field values.  

The generalization of the radio luminosity calculation to three CR spectral indexes and the inclusion of the maximum CR acceleration efficiency parameter $g_{\rm{CR}}$, following \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}, changes $j_{\nu}$ into:

\begin{eqnarray}
j_{\nu,\rm{final}} & = &g_{\rm{CR}} C(R) \rho_{\rm{gas}}(R) \frac{\epsilon_{\rm{B}}(R)}{\epsilon_{\rm{B}}(R)+\epsilon_{\rm{CMB}}} \nonumber \\
& \times & \Sigma_{i=1}^{3} \Delta_{i} A_{\nu,i} \left( \frac{\epsilon_{\rm{B}}(R)}{\epsilon_{B_{\rm{c}}}} \right)^{\frac{\alpha_{i}-2}{4}}  \, ,
\end{eqnarray}

where the sum is over the three CR spectral indexes $\alpha_{i}=(2.55,2.3,2.15)$ with the corresponding factors $\Delta_{i} = (0.767, 0.143, 0.0975)$ found by \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}.

\section{Cosmic Rays Modeling Details}
\label{app:B}

\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/CR_profiles_simple_comparison.eps}
\caption{Comparison of different CR profiles. The left plot shows $C_{\rm{simple}}$ for the Coma and Perseus cases both neglecting the temperature dependence ($\rho$) and considering it ($P$). The temperature profile of Coma has been modified so that it follows the characteristic decline toward the cluster periphery \citep{2007MNRAS.378..385P,2010MNRAS.409..449P}. Perseus is a CCC and it is characterized by a central dip in the temperature profile which may importantly affect the final CR profile, so we adopt the temperature profile as given in \citep{2004A&A...413...17P} ($P_{1}$). We also show the case where we only apply the characteristic decline toward the cluster periphery ($P_{2}$). The other two right plots show the \emph{transport} case of Coma and Perseus for different values of $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ in comparison with the \emph{simple} case. Additionally shown is the result in case of $C(R)=C_{\rm{semi-analytical}}(R)=\tilde{C}(R)\rho_{\rm{gas}}(R)/m_{\rm{p}}$ where $\tilde{C}(R)$ is the mass-dependent universal normalization CR profile found in cosmological simulations of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. The \emph{simple} and \emph{semi-analytical} profiles are normalized at $C_{0}=C(0)$. The transport cases are normalized at $C_{0}=C(0,\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100)$, where we fix the CR populations to have a constant total CR number as in Equation~(36) of \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} integrating up $R_{200}$. We adopt $\alpha=2.3$.}
\label{fig:simpleVStransport}
\end{figure*}

In order to make some comparisons between $C_{\rm{simple}}$ and $C_{\rm{transport}}$ we take as reference cases the NCCC Coma and the CCC Perseus. While for Coma the $\beta$-profile of Equation~(\ref{eq:beta_profile}) is a good approximation, and we take the \cite{1992A&A...259L..31B} profile, for Perseus a double-$\beta$ profile is needed. We adopt both the approximation $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rm{e}}(R)/n_{0}$, with $n_{\rm{e}}(R)$ the double-$\beta$ profile of \cite{2003ApJ...590..225C}, and the proper Perseus pressure profile as in Section~\ref{sec:3} (for Perseus, we take $R_{\rm{c}}$ to be equal to the outer double-$\beta$ profile core radius and we fix $\beta_{\rm{cl}}=0.8$). Note that the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} formalism is exact only for the approximation $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rm{e}}(R)/n_{0}$ and in the case of a $\beta$-profile. There is not an exact analytical solution for the case of a double-$\beta$ profile: one should use a numerical solution. In this work, we make different choices for $P(R)/P_{0}$ and we construct a model that has to be applied to all the halos of our sample. We therefore do not try to solve numerically each case. We just adopt the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} formalism as a good approximation. The relevant parameters are $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$, the exponential factor of Equation~(\ref{eq:Ctransport}), and the two radius $R_{\pm}$ that in general are very small/large so that the detail of $P(R)/P_{0}$ does not affect them critically. Indeed, we are dominated by other uncertainties, e.g. the assumption that the characteristic radius at which the turbulence is injected is the cluster core radius, and, despite the approximation, with this approach we capture the main CR transport effects.

We show the comparison between $C_{\rm{simple}}$ and $C_{\rm{transport}}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:simpleVStransport}, where we also show the result in case $C(R)=C_{\rm{semi-analytical}}(R)=\tilde{C}(R)\rho_{\rm{\rm{gas}}}(R)/m_{\rm{p}}$ where $\tilde{C}(R)$ is the mass-dependent universal normalization CR profile found in cosmological simulations of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. As expected, the CR profile driven by simulations is characterized by a more centrally peaked profile with respect to the analytical case. Note also the much more centrally peaked profile of Perseus with respect to Coma, which reflects their CCC and NCCC classification respectively, and the impact that have neglecting the temperature dependence in the Perseus case. Finally, the anticipated effect of varying the turbulent cluster state by means of $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}$ can be clearly appreciated.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/CR_profiles_REXexactVSfake.eps}
\caption{Comparison of $C_{\rm{transport}}(R)$ for the GNFW exact solution and the approximated case where we use the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} formulae with $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rm{e,GNFW}}(R)/n_{0}$. Both the NCCC and CCC case for the respective GNFW profiles derived in Section~\ref{sec:2.2} are shown. From top to bottom: $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100$, $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=10$ and $\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=1$. The normalization is done at $C_{0}=C(0,\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100)$ of the exact model where we fix the CR populations to have a constant total CR number as in Equation~(36) of \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} integrating up $R_{200}$. Note that the $C(0,\gamma_{\rm{tu}}=100)$ value for the CCC case is identical between the exact and approximated model, while there is a small difference of about 9\% in the NCCC case .We adopt $\alpha=2.3$.}
\label{fig:REXexactVSfake}
\end{figure}

We want to generalize the En{\ss}lin approach to our GNFW gas profiles obtained in Section~\ref{sec:2.2} and merge the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} analytical approach with the $\tilde{C}$ universal CR normalization obtained from simulations. Also in this case there is not an exact solution for the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} treatment of the problem. In fact, when trying to solve it analytically, one ends up with a 5-order equation. It is not practical to solve numerically such equation, and at the same time to discharge the unphysical solution, for our more than $10^4$ halos. For simplicity, we proceed with the approximation of using the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} formalism, after some modifications in order to adapt it to our case. In the case of taking just $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rm{e,GNFW}}(R)/n_{0}$, with $n_{\rm{e,GNFW}}$ the profile of Equation~(\ref{eq:gnfw}), there exist an exact solution following the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} treatment. Therefore, in order to qualitatively have an idea of how much is the error that we are making with the above described approach, in Figure~\ref{fig:REXexactVSfake} we compare the $C_{\rm{transport}}(R)$ of the GNFW exact solution and the approximate case where we use the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} formulae but just adopting $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rm{e,GNFW}}(R)/n_{0}$. In the second case, which after adding the temperature dependence will be our \emph{final} model, we fix $R_{-}=10^{-3}R/R_{200}$ to mimic the typical $R_{-}$ value of the exact solution, otherwise a unphysical step feature would appear around $10^{-2}R/R_{200}$. Note however that this modification does not change at all the model surface brightness and total luminosity. As clear from the figure, there is almost no appreciable difference between the two cases. This comparison indeed show that the approximated approach strategy can be safely followed in order to derive a fully working model s capturing the main CR transport effects.

\section{Gamma-ray Emission Calculation}
\label{app:C}

The gamma-ray flux above a certain energy $E_{\gamma}$ can be written as:

\begin{equation}
F_{\gamma} (E_{\gamma}) = \frac{1}{4\pi D^{2}} L_{\gamma} = 4\pi \int_{0}^{R_{500}} 2\pi S(R_{\perp}) R_{\perp} \rmn{d}R_{\perp} \, ,
\end{equation}

where $S(R_{\perp})$ is the surface brightness:

\begin{equation}
S(R_{\perp}) = 2 \int_{R_{\perp}}^{\infty} j_{\gamma}(R) \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^{2}-R_{\perp}^{2}}} \rmn{d}R \, ,
\end{equation}

with $ j_{\gamma}(R)=A_{\gamma} C(R) \rho_{\rm{gas}}(R)$. The parameter $A_{\gamma}$ is \citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P}:

\begin{eqnarray}
A_{\gamma} = g_{\rm{CR}} D_{\gamma,\rm{break}} \frac{4 m_{\pi^{0}} c}{3 m_{\rm{p}}^{2}} \Sigma_{i=1}^{3} \Delta_{i} \frac{\sigma_{\rm{pp},i}}{\alpha_{i} \delta_{i}} \left( \frac{m_{\rm{p}}}{2 m_{\pi^{0}}} \right)^{\alpha_{i}} \times \nonumber \\
\times \left[ \beta_{x} \left( \frac{\alpha_{i}+1}{2\delta_{i}}, \frac{\alpha_{i}-1}{2\delta_{i}} \right) \right]_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} \, ,
\end{eqnarray}

where $x_{j}=\left[ 1 + \left( \frac{m_{\pi^{0}}c^2}{2E_{\gamma,j}} \right)^{2\sigma_{i}} \right]$, $\left[ \beta_{x}(a,b) \right]_{x_1}^{x_2} = \beta_{x_2}(a,b)-\beta_{x_1}(a,b)$ and $\beta$ denotes the incomplete Beta-function \citep{1965hmfw.book.....A}, and $\delta_{i}=0.14\alpha_{i}^{-1.6}+0.44$. The term $D_{\gamma, \rm{break}}=D_{\gamma}(E_{\gamma},E_{\gamma,\rm{break}})$ represent diffusive CR losses due to escaping protons from the cluster at the equivalent photon energy for the break $E_{\gamma, \rm{break}}$ (see \citealp{2010MNRAS.409..449P} for details). $A_{\gamma}$ is expressed in cm$^3$~s$^{-1}$~g$^{-1}$. 

%The factor A_{\gamma}$ has dimensions of [cm$^3$~s$^{-1}$~g$^{-1}$] if $E_{\gamma}$ enters in [GeV], $\sigma_{pp}$ is expressed in [cm$^{-2}$], $m_{\pi}^{0}$ and $m_{p}$ are in [g] and the speed of light $c$ is expressed in [cm/s] (the factor $m_{\pi^{0}}c^2$ in $x_{j}$ must be therefore expressed in [GeV]). In this way, when the gas density $\rho_{\rm{gas}}(R)$ is expressed in [g~cm$^{-3}$] and the CR distribution $C(R)$ in [cm$^{-3}$], we obtain the gamma-ray flux above a given energy threshold $F_{\gamma}(E_{\gamma})$ expressed in [photons~cm~$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$].

\section{Observational Radio-to-X-ray Scaling relation and Luminosity Function}
\label{app:D}

For comparison with the observed 1.4~GHz radio-to-X-ray scaling relation, we use all the radio halos in the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} list, where we take the corresponding X-ray bolometric luminosities from \cite{2009A&A...507..661B}. We take 4 mini-halos from the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} list (excluding RXCJ1314.4-2515 and Z7160 because we did not find X-ray bolometric measurements for them, and A2626 because its bolometric X-ray luminosity would place it as an extreme outlier with respect to the others), and we add the Ophiuchus, A2029 and A1835 clusters \citep{2009A&A...499..371G}. We take X-ray bolometric luminosities form \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R} for Perseus, A2142, A2029,  PKS0745-191 and Ophiuchus, from \cite{Boehringer:1998vv} for A2390, and from \cite{2009ApJS..182...12C} (ACCEPT: Archive of Chandra Cluster Entropy Profile Tables; http://www.pa.msu.edu/astro/MC2/accept/) for A1835. For the mini-halos we do not have the errors on the X-ray bolometric luminosity and therefore we assume a $10\%$ error (this is true also for $L_{1.4}$ of all mini-halos apart A2390). Our final sample of RHs has a median redshift or $z\approx0.18$. Regarding the non-detected clusters in the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} list, we just take the 8 clusters for which we found ACCEPT bolometric X-ray luminosities. In Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ} left plot, we show the corresponding radio-to-X-ray scaling relation $L_{1.4~\rm{GHz}}-L_{\rm{X,bol}}$. The fit to observations, in the form of $\log_{10} (L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}/h_{70}^{-2}~\rmn{erg}~\rmn{s}^{-1}~\rmn{Hz}^{-1}) = A + B~\log_{10} (L_{ \rm{X,bol}}/h_{70}^{-2}~\rmn{erg}~\rmn{s}^{-1})$, results in $A=-50.433\pm2.226$ and $B=1.803\pm0.049$ and has a scatter of $\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.44$. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:RLFobs}, we make an attempt to construct a RLF from existing X-ray flux-limited radio surveys. There exist two such studies, the cluster radio survey done with the NVSS survey at $1.4$~GHz of \cite{1999NewA....4..141G} and the one done with GMRT at $610$~MHz by \cite{VenturiGMRT_1,VenturiGMRT_2}. From both of them we only select RHs, i.e. we do not consider radio relics or other diffuse radio emissions of unclear classification. The 1.4~GHz NVSS survey contains 13~RHs out of 205 analyzed clusters and the 610~MHz GMRT survey contains 6 RHs out of the observed 34. The sample finally analyzed by \cite{VenturiGMRT_1,VenturiGMRT_2} is composed by 50 clusters and we can also build a corresponding RLF at 1.4~GHz using the 12 present RHs as for all of them there exist 1.4~GHz measurements. The fractions of radio-loud clusters are about 6\%, 18\% and 24\% for the NVSS 1.4~GHz, GMRT 610~MHz and GMRT 1.4~GHz samples, respectively. The corresponding median redshift is 0.18, 0.26 and 0.25. We calculate the RLF using the classical $V_{max}$ estimator (see e.g.~\citealp{1976ApJ...207..700F}) correcting it for the incompleteness and sky coverage of the surveys. The most problematic aspect in obtaining these RLFs, apart the few available objects, is the calculation of a meaningful flux limit. We calculate it fitting the upper envelope of the luminosity-distance distribution of the three populations as shown in the insets of Figure~\ref{fig:RLFobs} following the procedure adopted by \cite{2011arXiv1106.5494B}. Note that it is particularly hard to calculate a meaningful flux limit for the GMRT survey due to its poor luminosity-distance RHs distribution. We decide therefore to take he 1.4~GHz NVSS RLF as reference in our comparisons with observation. However, we want to stress that several issues can affect this result as e.g.~the very reduced number of objects, and therefore the flux limit determination, and the Malmquist-Eddington bias. Indeed, the very different fraction of radio loud clusters obtained from different studies is a clear indicator of the large uncertainty in the RLF.

The three insets show the luminosity-distance distribution of the three samples (see main text for details) where the solid line is the fit to the upper envelope population, indicated in green, employed to calculate the flux limit for the classical $V_{max}$ estimator. The choice of the upper envelope population is somehow arbitrary, particularly in the GMRT cases due to the poor luminosity--distance distributions. The horizontal error bars represent the mass bins while the vertical error bars are Poissonian uncertainties.}

\del{In comparing with observations, we take as reference
  \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}. There are however many other works on this scaling
  relation, in particularly we recall the HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster
  Sample (HIFLUGCS; \citealp{2002ApJ...567..716R}), the REXCESS
  \citep{2009A&A...498..361P} sample, and the 115 \emph{Chandra} cluster sample
  of \cite{2007ApJ...668..772M}. The results on the slopes of the $L-M$ relation
  can vary significantly between different samples. While the slope of
  \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} is $1.63\pm0.06$,
  \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R}\footnote[8]{Note that we are quoting the
    $L_{\rm{bol}}-M_{200}$ results of \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R}.} found values
  between $1.72\pm0.09$ and $1.89\pm0.08$ (depending on the fit procedure, which
  also can affect the final result), \cite{2009A&A...498..361P} found
  $2.08\pm0.13$ and \cite{2007ApJ...668..772M} found
  $1.96\pm0.10$. Discrepancies can come from many different sources but likely
  are to be charged to the selection criteria of the different samples as
  recently pointed out also by \cite{2011arXiv1109.3708R}. Samples which differ
  in e.g.~redshift distribution, mass range, fitting procedure and biases
  treatment, and, of course, the used instrument, can give and actually gave
  different results. Therefore we decided to take as reference the
  \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} work because it is very recent, their sample is
  composed by a high number (238) of objects, and, more importantly, their
  analysis takes self-consistently into account all selection effects,
  covariances, systematic uncertainties and the cluster mass function (see also
  \citealp{2010MNRAS.406.1759M}).}
