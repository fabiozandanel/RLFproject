\abstract{The underlying physics of giant radio halos and mini halos in galaxy
  clusters is still an open question, which becomes more pressing with the
  growing number of radio halo detections. In this paper, we explore the
  possibility that radio-emitting electrons are generated in hadronic cosmic ray
  (CR) proton interactions with ambient thermal protons of the intra-cluster
  medium. Our CR model derives from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of
  cluster formation and additionally accounts for CR transport in the form of CR
  streaming and diffusion.  This opens the possibility of changing the radio
  halo luminosity by more than an order of magnitude on a dynamical time
  scale. We build a mock galaxy cluster catalog from the large MultiDark
  $N$-body $\Lambda$CDM simulation by adopting a phenomenological gas density
  model for each cluster based on X-ray measurements that matches
  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray scaling relations and luminosity function.  Using
  magnetic field strength estimates from Faraday rotation measure studies, our
  model successfully reproduces the observed surface brightness profiles of
  giant radio halos (Coma, A2163) as well as radio mini-halos (Perseus,
  Ophiuchus), while obeying upper limits on the gamma-ray emission in these
  clusters. Because of CR streaming transport and the different scalings of the
  X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rmn{X}}$, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, $Y$, with
  respect to gas density, our model is also able to simultaneously reproduce the
  observed bimodality of radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters at the same
  $L_{\rmn{X}}$ as well as the unimodal distribution of radio-halo luminosity
  versus $Y$; thereby suggesting a physical solution to this apparent
  contradiction. For a plausible fraction of 10\% radio-loud clusters, our model
  matches the NVSS radio-halo luminosity function. Constructing an analytical
  radio-halo luminosity function, we demonstrate the unique prospects for
  low-frequency radio surveys (such as the LOFAR Tier 1 survey) to detect
  $\sim3500$ radio halos back to redshift two and to probe the underlying
  physics of radio halos.}

The presence of large-scale diffuse radio synchrotron emission in clusters of
galaxies proves the existence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields
permeating the intra-cluster medium (ICM) (see,
e.g, \citealp{2004NewAR..48.1137F}).  Diffuse cluster radio emission can be
separated in two classes: radio halos and radio relics (see,
e.g., \citealp{2004rcfg.procE..25K,2008SSRv..134...93F}).  Radio
\mbox{(mini-)}halos (RHs) are centered on clusters and characterized by a
regular and unpolarized morphology, resembling the morphology of the thermal
X-ray emission. On the contrary, radio relics typically lie at the cluster
outskirts, have an irregular morphology, and often show a high degree of
polarization. While relics seem to directly trace structure formation shocks
(see, e.g., \citealp{2011A&A...533A..35V}), the explanation for the RH phenomenon
is challenging and still an open question.
                                   
Two principal models have been proposed to explain RHs.  In the ``hadronic
model'' the radio emitting electrons are produced in hadronic cosmic ray (CR)
proton interactions with protons of the ambient thermal ICM, requiring only a
very modest fraction of (at most) a few percent of CR-to-thermal pressure (see
\citealp{1980ApJ...239L..93D,1982AJ.....87.1266V, 1999APh....12..169B,
  2000A&A...362..151D, 2001ApJ...559...59M, 2001ApJ...562..233M,
  2003A&A...407L..73P, 2004A&A...413...17P, 2004MNRAS.352...76P,
  2007IJMPA..22..681B, 2008MNRAS.385.1211P, 2008MNRAS.385.1242P,
  2009JCAP...09..024K, 2010MNRAS.401...47D, 2010arXiv1003.0336D,
  2010arXiv1003.1133K, 2010arXiv1011.0729K, 2011A&A...527A..99E}).  CR protons
and heavier nuclei, like electrons, can be accelerated and injected into the ICM
by structure formation shocks, active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galactic winds.
Due to their higher masses with respect to electrons, CR protons are accelerated
more efficiently to relativistic energies and are expected to show a ratio of
the spectral energy flux of CR protons to electrons above 1 GeV of about 100,
similarly to what is observed in our Galaxy
\citep{2002cra..book.....S}. Additionally, CR protons have a radiative cooling
time larger than that of the electrons by the square of the mass ratio and
therefore can accumulate in clusters for cosmological times
\citep{1996SSRv...75..279V}. Indeed, CR electrons suffer more severe energy
losses via synchrotron and inverse Compton emission at particle energies $E
\gtrsim 100$~MeV, and Coulomb losses below that energy range.  

In the ``re-acceleration model'', RHs are thought to be the result of
re-acceleration of electrons through interactions with plasma waves during
powerful states of ICM turbulence, as a consequence of a cluster merger (see
\citealp{1987A&A...182...21S, 1993ApJ...406..399G, 2002A&A...386..456G,
  2004MNRAS.350.1174B, 2005MNRAS.363.1173B, 2007MNRAS.378..245B,
  2010arXiv1008.0184B, 2009A&A...507..661B}). This, however, requires a
sufficiently long-lived CR electron population at energies around 100~MeV which
has to be continuously maintained by re-acceleration at a rate faster than the
cooling processes.  We refer the reader to \citet{2011A&A...527A..99E} for a
discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of these two models.

RHs can be divided in two classes. Giant radio halos are typically associated
with merging clusters and have large extensions, e.g., the Coma radio halo has an
extension of about 2~Mpc. Radio mini-halos are associated with relaxed clusters
that harbor a cool core and typically extend over a few hundred kilo-parsecs,
e.g., the Perseus radio mini-halo has an extension of about 0.2~Mpc.  The
observed morphological similarities with the thermal X-ray emission suggests
that RHs may be of hadronic origin. In fact, cool-core clusters (CCCs) are
characterized by high thermal X-ray emissivities and ICM densities that are more
peaked in comparison to (merging) non cool-core clusters (NCCCs) (see,
e.g., \citealp{2008A&A...487..431C}). This distinct difference in the ICM density
structure of CCCs and NCCCs is reflected in the morphology of the two observed
classes of RHs.

The RH luminosity seems to be correlated to the thermal X-ray luminosity (see,
e.g., \citealp{2009A&A...507..661B,2011A&A...527A..99E}).  However, a large
fraction of clusters does not exhibit significant diffuse synchrotron
emission. Galaxy clusters with the same thermal X-ray luminosity show an
apparent bimodality with respect to their radio luminosity. Either they harbor a
RH or they do not have any detectable diffuse radio emission
\citep{2009A&A...507..661B,2011A&A...527A..99E}.  This suggests the existence of
a switch-on/switch-off mechanism that is able to change the radio luminosity by
more than one order of magnitude.  While such a mechanism could be easily
realized in the framework of the re-acceleration model
\citep{2009A&A...507..661B}, the \emph{classical} hadronic model predicts the
presence of RHs in all clusters. The failure to reproduce the observed cluster
radio-to-X-ray bimodality was one of the main criticisms against the hadronic
model.  Additionally, the \emph{classical} hadronic model cannot reproduce some
spectral features observed in clusters, such as the total spectral curvature
claimed in the Coma radio halo or the spectral steepening observed at the
boundary of some RHs. However, the recent report of spectral flattening with
energy of the radio halo in A2256 \citep{2012A&A...543A..43V} rises the question
whether such a variability among different source of the same class is inherent
to the underlying physics or whether it is a signature of uncertainty in the
algorithms used to process the data.

In a recent work, \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} assess these problems of the
\emph{classical} hadronic model by analyzing CR transport processes within a
cluster. While CR advection with turbulently driven flows results in centrally
enhanced CR profiles, the propagation in form of CR streaming and diffusion
produces a flattening of CR profiles. Hence, different CR transport phenomena
may also account for the observed bimodality of the radio luminosity in the
hadronic model and may also explain the spectral features observed in some
clusters \citep{2011A&A...527A..99E}. Note that these CR transport phenomena
were not considered in earlier analytical works (see, e.g.,
\citealp{2004A&A...413...17P}) as well as in previous hydrodynamic simulations
(see, e.g., \citealp{2001ApJ...562..233M, 2008MNRAS.385.1211P,
  2010MNRAS.409..449P}).

More recently, \cite{2012MNRAS.421L.112B} presented the first scaling relations
between RH luminosity and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) flux measurements, using the
\emph{Planck} cluster catalogue. While the correlation agrees with previous
scaling measurements based on X-ray data, there is no indication for a bimodal
cluster population dividing clusters into radio-loud and radio-quiet objects at
fixed SZ flux. While the SZ flux correlates tightly with cluster mass, the X-ray
luminosity, $L_\rmn{X}$, exhibits a larger scatter. The CCCs predominantly
populate the high-$L_\rmn{X}$ tail (at any cluster temperature) and make up
approximately half of the radio-quiet objects \citep{2011A&A...527A..99E}. This
suggests that the switch-on/switch-off mechanism may not operate at fixed
$L_\rmn{X}$ but also causes an evolution of that quantity. As the cluster
relaxes after a merger, it cools and forms a denser core. Simultaneously,
$L_\rmn{X}$ is expected to {\em increase} which may simultaneously {\em
  decrease} the radio luminosity owing to the decaying turbulence that is
responsible in maintaining the radio emission in either model (that accounts for
microscopic CR transport).
 
An observational test that is able to disentangle between the hadronic and
re-acceleration models is the gamma-ray emission resulting from neutral pion
decays, a secondary product of the hadronic CR interaction with protons of the
ICM, which is not predicted by the re-acceleration model. Such observational
efforts have been undertaken in the last few years (for space-based cluster
observations in the GeV-band, see \citealt{2003ApJ...588..155R,
  2010ApJ...717L..71A, 2010JCAP...05..025A, 2012AAS...21920701Z,
  2012arXiv1201.1003H}; for ground-based observations in the energy band
$\gtrsim100$~GeV, see \citealt{2006ApJ...644..148P, 2008AIPC.1085..569P,
  2009A&A...495...27A, 2009arXiv0907.0727T, 2009arXiv0907.3001D,
  2009arXiv0907.5000G, cangaroo_clusters, 2009ApJ...706L.275A,
  2010ApJ...710..634A, 2011arXiv1111.5544M}) without being able to detect
cluster gamma-ray emission\footnote{Recently, \cite{2012arXiv1201.1003H} claimed
  an evidence for diffuse gamma-ray emission in the \emph{Fermi} satellite data
  of the Virgo cluster which however needs to be carefully scrutinized by
  varying the uncertain foreground modeling (for a preliminary assessment of the
  \emph{Fermi} collaboration, see Elliot Bloom's talk at the UCLA Dark Matter
  2012 conference, https://hepconf.physics.ucla.edu/dm12/).}.  Gamma-ray limits
enable us to put significant constraints on the relative CR pressure
contributions. The long observational campaign of the Perseus galaxy cluster
performed by the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes
constrains the cluster average CR-to-thermal pressure to be less than a few
percent \citep{2010ApJ...710..634A,2011arXiv1111.5544M}. Comparing the
corresponding upper limits to predictions of simulations by
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} constrains the maximum CR acceleration efficiency at
structure formation shocks to be $<50\%$.  Alternatively, this may indeed
suggest the presence of non-negligible CR transport processes into the outer
cluster regions as suggested by \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}.  Constraints at the
same level are confirmed by the \emph{Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT)
data on the Coma cluster \citep{2011arXiv1105.3240P, 2012AAS...21920701Z,
  2012arXiv1201.1003H}. To summarize, gamma-ray observations are not yet
sensitive enough to severely challenge hadronic models of RHs.

An important step towards understanding the generating mechanism of RHs could
come from detailed RH population analyses. To date, we know of 53 clusters that
harbor RHs (see \citealp{2012A&ARv..20...54F}, for an almost up-to-date
list). Only two X-ray flux-limited studies have been conducted that assess the
important question of the RH frequency in clusters \citep{1999NewA....4..141G,
  VenturiGMRT_2}. Since the number of RHs in such X-ray flux-limited samples is
small with typically a few RHs, the conclusions on the underlying physical
mechanisms of RHs are not very robust. Fortunately, this is going to change
thanks to the next-generation of low-frequency radio observatories such as the
Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) which officially started operations in
2010.\footnote{www.lofar.org} In fact, a deep cluster survey is part of the
LOFAR science key projects and expected to provide a large number of
radio-emitting galaxy clusters up to redshift $z\approx1$ (see,
e.g., \citealp{2010A&A...509A..68C,2012JApA..tmp...34R}).  This will hopefully
permit to clearly determine the RH phenomenology with respect to galaxy cluster
properties such as the fractions of radio-loud/quiet, non cool-core/cool-core,
and non-merging/merging clusters, and to explore the role of different
parameters like the magnetic field, the CR acceleration efficiency, and CR
transport properties.

In this work, we use a sample of galaxy clusters up to $z= 1$, obtained from the
MultiDark $N$-body cosmological simulation \citep{2011arXiv1104.5130P}. We
construct a \emph{phenomenological} model to assign a gas density profile to
each halo in the MultiDark simulation that is based on observed X-ray cluster
properties. We assume that the RHs are generated by secondaries of hadronic CR
interactions with the ICM. In adopting the hadronic scenario, we construct a
\emph{hybrid} CR model and merge the result of hydrodynamic simulations by
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} and the analytical model by
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}.  As anticipated above, the inclusion of the latter
is particularly important as CR transport processes have a dramatic impact on
the emission profile and normalization. We will show that this approach enables
us not only to reproduce the radio surface brightness profiles but also the
radio-to-X-ray and radio-to-SZ scaling relations. Hence, this explicitly
demonstrates that the hadronic model is an attractive model that matches all
current observational constraints and predicts the luminosity function for the
LOFAR cluster survey.

In Section~\ref{sec:2}, we explain the methodology of assigning gas density
profiles to dark matter (DM) halos and demonstrate that the model reproduces the
observed SZ and X-ray scaling relations and luminosity function. We then
construct the model for the CR distribution in clusters. In Section~\ref{sec:3},
we apply our model to observed surface brightness profiles of individual RHs and
explore the allowable parameter space for CRs and magnetic fields. In
Section~\ref{sec:4}, we compare the modeled radio-to-X-ray and radio-to-SZ
scaling relations to current observations and show how they vary for different
choices of our CR and magnetic parametrizations. In Section~\ref{sec:5}, we show
the radio luminosity functions, compare them to current observational
constraints and provide predictions for the LOFAR cluster survey. Finally, in
Section~\ref{sec:6}, we present our conclusions. In this work, the cluster mass
$M_{\Delta}$ and radius $R_{\Delta}$ are defined with respect to a density that
is $\Delta=200$ or $\Delta=500$ times the \emph{critical} density of
universe. We adopt density parameters of $\Omega_{\rmn{m}}=0.3$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7$ and today's Hubble constant of $H_0 = 100 \times
h_{70}$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$ where $h_{70} = 0.7$.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:2}
The two basic ingredients of this work are an $N$-body, \emph{DM-only}
cosmological simulation that we use in constructing our complete cluster sample,
and the (non-)thermal emission model. Here, we use the MultiDark simulation that
will be described in Section~\ref{sec:2.1}, along with our final cluster
sample. As we will see, for any given cluster, the necessary ingredients for the
emission model are mass, temperature, and gas density distribution. We assign to
each cluster in that simulation a gas density profile that is phenomenologically
constructed from state-of-art X-ray observations, as will be shown in
Section~\ref{sec:2.2}. We will show that this approach can successfully
reproduce the known X-ray cluster characteristics, such as the X-ray luminosity
function (XLF), the luminosity-mass relation, $L_{\rmn{X}}- M$, and the
$Y_{\rmn{X}}-M$ relation, where $Y_{\rmn{X}}=M_\rmn{gas}k_{\rmn{B}}T$ with an
X-ray-derived gas mass $M_{\rmn{gas}}$ and temperature $T$
\citep{2006ApJ...650..128K}. Moreover, we compare our $Y_{\rmn{SZ}}-M$ relation
with SZ-derived measurements.  Only if our model matches available cluster data
on the gas properties, we can start to explore different parametrizations of CR
physics and its implications for the radio and gamma-ray emission, as will be
explained in Section~\ref{sec:2.3}.

\subsection{MultiDark simulation and final cluster sample}
\label{sec:2.1}
The MultiDark simulation used in this work is
described in detail in \cite{2011arXiv1104.5130P} and
\cite{2011arXiv1109.0003R}.  It is an $N$-body cosmological simulation done with
the Adaptive-Refinement-Tree (ART) code \citep{1997ApJS..111...73K} of
$2048^3$ particles within a ($1000$~Mpc~$h^{-1}$)$^3$ cube. The latest WMAP5 and
WMAP7 cosmological parameters were used. This simulation is particularly well
suited for our purpose because of its large number of clusters.
 
We use the MultiDark halo catalog from its on-line database,\footnote{www.multidark.org.} 
constructed with the Bound Density Maxima algorithm \citep{1997astro.ph.12217K}.  
We will mainly use $M_{500}$ and $R_{500}$ for comparison with existing observational works.  
We use the technique described in \cite{2003ApJ...584..702H} to convert $M_{200}$ and
$R_{200}$ provided by the MultiDark halo catalog to $M_{500}$ and $R_{500}$.  In
creating our cluster sample we only select distinct halos, i.e., those halos that
are not sub-halos of any other halo, which by definition are not galaxy clusters.

Additionally, we assume that the main emission mechanism in the ICM is thermal
bremsstrahlung, which is true only above a particle energy of approximately
$2.6$~keV \citep{1988xrec.book.....S}. Below this
energy, there could be other important contributions to the emission,
e.g., from atomic lines. Therefore, we impose a mass cut of
$M_{200}\geq1\times10^{14}$~$h^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}\approx1.4\times10^{14}$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}$
which ensures $k_{\rmn{B}}T \gtrsim 2.6$~keV, assuming the $M_{500} - T_{\rmn{ci}}$ relation
of \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}.

The LOFAR radio observatory is expected to detect RHs up to redshift $z \approx
1$. Thus, we make use of different simulation snapshots up to $z=1$. In
Table~\ref{tab:z}, we show the total cluster number in our final cluster sample
at different redshifts.

\subsection{Gas density modeling}
\label{sec:2.2}

We decided to use a \emph{phenomenological} approach and to construct the gas
density profiles directly from X-ray observations. A suitable X-ray sample that
provides the needed information is the \emph{Representative XMM-Newton Cluster
  Structure Survey} (REXCESS) sample \citep{2008A&A...487..431C,
  2009A&A...498..361P}. It is a sample of 31 galaxy clusters of different
dynamical states at redshifts $0.06<z<0.18$ with detailed information on the
de-projected electron density profiles \citep{2008A&A...487..431C}. In
Figure~\ref{fig:gas_profiles}, we show the 31 electron density profiles of the
REXCESS sample color-coded by CCCs and NCCCs.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/gas_profiles.eps}
\caption{Electron density profiles of the 31 clusters in the REXCESS sample. Grey and black lines represent NCCCs and CCCs, respectively. The blue and red lines represent our GNFW mean profile for the NCCCs and CCCs, respectively.}
\label{fig:gas_profiles}
\end{figure}

In order to obtain an electron density profile that we will attach to our
simulated clusters, we use a generalized Navarro-Frank-White (GNFW) profile,
\begin{equation}
n_{\rmn{e}}(x) = \frac{n_{0}}{x^{\beta}\left[1+x^{\alpha}\right]^{\frac{\delta-\beta}{\alpha}}},
\label{eq:gnfw}
\end{equation}
where $x=R/R_{\rmn{c}}$ and $R_{\rmn{c}}$ is the cluster core radius. To reduce
the dimensionality of our fit, we fix representative values of $R_{\rmn{c}} =
0.2\, R_{500}$, $\alpha = 1$ and $\delta = 2.5$. We fit the radial density
profiles of the REXCESS sample in log-log space, separating them in the two
categories of NCCCs and CCCs as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gas_profiles}.  We
obtain $n_{\rmn{0,NCCC}} = 1.02\times10^{-2}$~$h_{70}^{1/2}$~cm$^{-3}$,
$n_{\rmn{0,CCC}} = 8.32\times10^{-3}$~$h_{70}^{1/2}$~cm$^{-3}$,
$\beta_{\rmn{NCCC}} = -0.093$, and $\beta_{\rmn{CCC}} = 0.592$. The resulting
fits are shown in blue and red for the NCCC and CCC population, respectively.

The next step is to introduce a mass-scaling in order to apply our GNFW profiles
to all our clusters. We adopt the gas mass fraction-mass scaling,
$f_{\rmn{gas},500}-M_{500}$ of \cite{2009ApJ...693.1142S} (and adopt their Equation~(8)). We can
express $f_{\rmn{gas},500}$ in the following way:
\begin{equation}
f_{\rmn{gas},500} = \frac{M_{\rmn{gas},500}}{M_{500}}  = \frac{\int_{0}^{R_{500}} \rho_{\rmn{gas}} \rmn{d}V}{M_{500}}
\label{eq:m500}
\end{equation}
with $\rho_{\rmn{gas}}(R) = \rho_{\rmn{gas}} = n_{\rmn{e}} m_{\rmn{p}} / ( X_{\rmn{H}}X_{\rmn{e}} )$ where
$m_{\rmn{p}}$ is the proton mass, $X_{\rmn{H}} = 0.76$ is the primordial hydrogen
mass fraction and $X_{\rmn{e}} = 1.157$ the ratio of electron-to-hydrogen number
densities in the fully ionized ICM \citep{1988xrec.book.....S}. For each cluster
$i$ of our sample, we then define a \emph{mass-scaled} gas profile as
$\rho_{\rmn{gas},i}=C_{i} \,\rho_{\rmn{gas}}$ with:
\begin{eqnarray}
%C_{i}  =  (0.0616\pm(0.0060g_{1}))  h_{73}^{-1.5}  \left(\frac{M_{500,i}}{10^{13} h_{73}^{-1} \rmn{M_{\odot}}}\right)^{0.135\pm(0.030g_{2})} \nonumber \\
C_{i}  & = &  (0.0656\pm(0.0064g_{1})) \, h_{70}^{-1.5}  \nonumber \\
 & \times & \left(\frac{M_{500,i}}{1.04 \times 10^{13} h_{70}^{-1} \rmn{M_{\odot}}}\right)^{0.135\pm(0.030g_{2})} \frac{M_{500,i}}{\int_{0}^{R_{500,i}} \rho_{\rmn{gas}} \rmn{d}V}
\label{eq:gas_scaling}
\end{eqnarray}
where $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ are random Gaussian number which we use in order to
simulate the natural scatter of the gas profiles.\footnote{The values
  $0.0064$ and $0.03$ quoted in Equation~(\ref{eq:gas_scaling}) do not represent
  the proper scatter of the $f_{\rmn{gas},500}-M_{500}$ relation but reflect the
  parameter errors and we rescaled the numerical values to a Hubble constant of
  $h_{70}$ used in this work.}

Hence, for each cluster in our sample we obtain a gas density profile
$\rho_{\rmn{gas},i}$ that obeys the observed $f_{gas,500}-M_{500}$ relation and
is uniquely determined by its DM mass $M_{500,i}$ and by the property of being a
NCCC or CCC. We assign the latter property to every halo depending on its
merging history. In particular, we make use of the offset parameter
$X_{\rmn{off}}$ computed for the MultiDark halo catalog. This is defined as the
distance from the halo center to the center of mass in units of the virial
radius. This parameter assesses the dynamical state of the cluster and whether
the halo experienced a recent merger or not. Current observations reveal a ratio
of NCCCs and CCCs of about $50\%$ (see, e.g., \citealp{2007A&A...466..805C,
  2009MNRAS.395..764S}). Since there is a correlation between merging clusters
and NCCCs, we use the median of the $X_{\rmn{off}}$ distribution to separate our
sample into CCCs and NCCCs (with NCCCs defined to be those halos with the larger
dynamical offsets). Clearly, this is an over-simplification, and future X-ray
surveys will have to determine this property also as a function of redshift.

We also account for redshift evolution of the gas profiles. While our NCCC and
CCC gas profiles as derived from the REXCESS cluster sample are merely used to
define a profile shape, the normalization of the gas profiles is set by the
observational $f_{\rmn{gas},500}-M_{500}$ relation \citep{2009ApJ...693.1142S}.
The 43 clusters used in \cite{2009ApJ...693.1142S} have redshifts $0.012 < z <
0.12$ with a \emph{median} of $z \approx 0.04$. Thus, our phenomenological gas
profile is representative of the cluster population at $z\approx0$. To extend this
profile to high-$z$, we include a \emph{self-similar} scaling of the gas density
as $\rho_{\rmn{gas}}(z) = E(z)^{2} \rho_{\rmn{gas}}(z=0)$, where $E(z)^{2} =
\Omega_{\rmn{m}} (1+z)^{3} + \Omega_{{\Lambda}}$.


\subsection{X-ray and SZ scaling relations}
\label{sec:X-SZ-scaling}

In order to check whether our phenomenologically derived gas profiles reproduce
the observations, we calculate the bolometric X-ray thermal bremsstrahlung
luminosity $L_{\rmn{bol}}$ as in \cite{1988xrec.book.....S}\footnote{We check
  our procedure by fitting each of the 31 REXCESS clusters with
  Equation~(\ref{eq:gnfw}) and calculating $L_{\rmn{bol}}$ with the measured gas
  temperature of each cluster. As a result, we fall short of the observed
  luminosity by a mean (median) of about $21\%$ ($20\%$). This is reasonable
  considering that we do not permit the parameters $R_{\rmn{c}}$, $\alpha$ and
  $\delta$ to vary between different objects. Additionally, we neglect atomic
  line emission which may give a noticeable contribution, in particularly for
  low-mass clusters and in the cluster outskirts of larger systems.}  and
compare our sample result with the observed $L_{\rmn{bol}} - M_{500}$ relation
and XLF.\footnote{The mean (median) difference at $z=0$ between
  $L_{\rmn{bol}}$ within $R_{200}$ or within $R_{500}$ is $\approx 5\%$ ($\approx
  7\%$). While $L_{\rmn{bol}}$ refers to the quantity calculated within
  $R_{500}$, we note that the XLF for luminosities calculated within $R_{200}$
  will be barely changed.}

To assign a temperature to our model clusters (that is needed for calculating
$L_{\rmn{bol}}$ and $Y_{\rmn{X}}$), we adopt the $T-M_{500}$ relation by
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M},
\begin{equation}
\log_{10} \left( \frac{k_{\rmn{B}}T_{\rmn{ci}}}{\rmn{keV}} \right) = 
A + B~\log_{10} \left( \frac{E(z) M_{500}}{10^{15} h_{70}^{-1} \rmn{M_{\odot}}} \right)
\label{eq:temp}
\end{equation}
where $A=0.91$, $B=0.46$, and $T_{\rmn{ci}}$ is the cluster temperature \emph{not}
centrally excised (see
\citealp{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}). \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} report a scatter of
$\sigma_{\rmn{yx}} = 0.06,$\footnote{Scatter is calculated as $\sigma_{\rmn{yx}}
  = \sqrt{ \left\{ \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} [Y_{i}-(A+B~X_{i})]^{2}\right\} / N-1}$
  where the sum extends over the data points $X_{i}, Y_{i}$, and $A$ and $B$ are
  the fit parameters.} which we apply to our sample using Gaussian deviates.

  }
\label{fig:X_LM}
\end{figure*}

In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:X_LM}, we show how our model
$L_{\rmn{bol}}-M_{500}$ relation compares with observations by
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} (\emph{all} data, see their Table~7). Their sample is
composed of 238 clusters at $0.02<z<0.46$ with a median of $z \approx 0.2$ and
self-consistently takes into account all selection effects, covariances,
systematic uncertainties and the cluster mass function \citep{2010MNRAS.406.1759M}. 
For this reason, we compare the \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} data to our model at $z=0.2$, 
and limit the comparison to the mass range covered by the observations. Overall, there is
reassuring agreement between our phenomenological model and the data, which
probe our model most closely on scales around the cluster core radii (which is
where the contribution to $L_{\rmn{X}}$ per logarithmic interval in radius, $\dd
L_{\rmn{X}}/\dd\log r \propto r^3 n_{\rm{gas}}^2(r) \sqrt{k_{\rmn{B}}T}$, attains its maximum).  In
Table~\ref{tab:LMfits}, we show our model $L_{\rmn{bol}}-M_{500}$ scaling
relation and its scatter for different redshifts. We find that the scatter of
our samples at all redshifts are Gaussian distributed with a standard deviation
of $\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.18$ that matches the observational results of
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}, which report a scatter of $\sigma_{yx} = 0.185$.

In the middle panel of Figure~\ref{fig:X_LM}, we compare the
$Y_{\rmn{X}}-M_{500}$ relation of our sample to observational data
\citep{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}. The model agrees nicely at the high-mass end, but
underpredicts the observed scaling at low masses by about $20\%$ (at the
1-$\sigma$ level). This is the same level of deviation from the data as in the
case of $L_{\rmn{X}}$, which is more significant due to the smaller scatter in
the $Y_{\rmn{X}}$ relation. The differential contribution to the thermal energy
per logarithmic interval in radius (and hence to the integrated Compton-$y$
parameter) is given by $\dd Y /\dd\log r \propto r^3 P_{\rmn{th}}(r)$, with the
thermal gas pressure $P_{\rmn{th}}=n_{\rmn{gas}}k_{\rmn{B}}T$. It peaks at
scales slightly smaller than $R_{500}$ with 1-$\sigma$ contributions extending
out to $3\,R_{500}$ \citep{2010ApJ...725...91B}. Hence, the observational
scaling constrains our model on those large scales, quite complementary to the
X-ray luminosity. The deviations at small masses either indicates different
assumptions about $f_{\rmn{gas}}$, the gas temperature, or different selection
effects of either observational sample that we use for model calibration and
comparison.  \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} determine their masses by adopting a
constant value for $f_{\rmn{gas}}$, in contrast to our approach which adopts the
observed $f_{\rmn{gas},500}-M_{500}$ relation given by
\cite{2009ApJ...693.1142S}. Additionally, we adopt the
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} \emph{centrally included} temperature throughout all
our work, while \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} use the \emph{centrally excised}
temperature to calculate $Y_{\rmn{X}}$. This assumption also impacts the scatter
of the $Y_{\rmn{X}}-M$ relation. In fact, using the \emph{centrally included}
temperature, we found a scatter of $\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.11$ (see
Table~\ref{tab:YXfits} where our $Y_{\rmn{X}}$ scaling relations are reported),
significantly higher than the value of $\sigma_{yx} = 0.052$ found by
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}.

In the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:X_LM}, we compare the
$Y_{\rmn{SZ}}-M_{500}$ relation in our model (calculated as in Equation~(3) of
\citealp{2011arXiv1109.3709B}) with the observed scaling relation by the
\cite{2011A&A...536A..11P}. Their sample contains clusters up to $z \approx
0.45$ and has a median of $z \approx 0.15$; hence, we compare the data to our
relation at the MultiDark snapshot $z=0.16$ (that contains 11419 clusters above
our mass cut) which however is not used throughout the rest of the work. Our
model reproduces the data remarkably well, except for the high-mass end where
our simulations have a weaker constraining power due to the smaller box size in
comparison to the survey volume of {\em Planck}.  We find a scatter of
$\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.11$ which compares well with the \emph{Planck} result of
$\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.1$. In Table~\ref{tab:YSZfits}, we report our SZ scaling
relations for different redshifts.

\subsection{X-ray luminosity function}

Studies of the XLF got out of fashion during the last years due to the
difficulties of using the X-ray luminosity for cosmological purposes. The X-ray
emissivity scales with the square of the gas density, which makes it subject to
density variations and clumping. This implies large scatter that causes a large
Malmquist bias and underlines the necessity of careful mock surveys that need to
address all systematics.

Nevertheless, it provides a complementary check for our model. To this end, we
use the \emph{ROSAT} brightest cluster sample (BCS) XLF
\citep{1997ApJ...479L.101E}, which is in good agreement with results from the
\emph{ROSAT} ESO Flux-Limited X-ray (REFLEX; \citealp{2002ApJ...566...93B}) and
HIFLUGCS \citep{2002ApJ...567..716R}.  Note that the XLF is fully determined by
the mass function and the $L_{\rmn{X}}-M_{500}$ relation after taking into
account the observational biases. This means that applying the Malmquist and
Eddington bias corrected $L_{\rmn{X}}-M_{500}$ relation by
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} directly to the MultiDark mass function and
accounting for the observational scatter in $L_{\rmn{X}}-M_{500}$ should yield
an unbiased XLF. We show the resulting bolometric and soft-band ($0.1-2.4$~keV)
XLF in Figure~\ref{fig:XLF} and compare those to the corresponding BCS XLFs and
to our model predictions. Note that there is only the Schechter fit available
for the BCS bolometric XLF.  While the soft-band XLF by
\cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} agrees well with the BCS data points, it deviates
from the corresponding Schechter fit at low luminosities. This is also true in
the bolometric band, where the XLFs of \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} and our model
agree well, but deviate from the BCS Schechter fit at low luminosities. This may
be an artifact due to the use of Schechter fit instead of the data points or may
point to incompleteness of the BCS sample. Note that the Poissonian errors of
the XLF obtained from the MultiDark simulation are a lower limit as we are
neglecting the uncertainty due to cosmic variance.  Studies of the XLF will
become again an important topic with the upcoming launch of the eROSITA
satellite (see, e.g., \citealp{2011MSAIS..17..159C}) and further studies in this
direction are desirable. For these reasons, we do not show XLF predictions at
other redshifts, leaving this for a future study.

\caption{Bolometric and soft-band ($0.1-2.4$~keV) XLFs. Shown are the soft-band

  soft-band XLF, which was obtained applying the \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}
  $L_{\rmn{X}}-M_{500}$ relation to the MultiDark $z = 0.1$ snapshot, compares
  well with the BCS data points, it deviates from the corresponding Schechter
  fit. We also show the bolometric XLF of \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} and
  bolometric XLF of our model at $z=0.1$. The XLFs are calculated in equally
  log-spaced mass bins; the error bars represent the Poissonian errors. Note
  that we limit the comparison to the luminosity range covered by our sample,
  where we cut the lowest part because in that range the XLF rapidly drops due
  to the imposed mass cut.  }
\label{fig:XLF}
\end{figure}

Summarizing, our phenomenological approach provides viable gas densities that
reproduce the observed scaling relations of the ICM as well as the XLF. Thus, we
will apply it in the following to model the CR population in galaxy clusters and
to predict the radio and gamma-ray emission of our sample.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cosmic ray modeling}
\label{sec:2.3}
We assume a power-law for the CR proton distribution, $f(R,p) \dd p=C(R) p^{-\alpha} \dd p$,
which is the effective one-dimensional momentum distribution (assuming isotropy
in momentum space). We are interested in calculating the radio synchrotron (and
gamma-ray) emission resulting from secondaries of hadronic CR interactions with
protons of the ICM. To start, we provide the synchrotron emissivity $j_{\nu}$, at
frequency $\nu$ and per steradian, of a steady-state electron population where
radiative cooling balances injection from hadronic interactions (adapted from
\citealp{2008MNRAS.385.1211P} and \citealp{2011A&A...527A..99E}),
\begin{equation}
j_{\nu}  =  A_\nu C(R) \rho_{\rmn{gas}}(R) 
\frac{\epsilon_{\rmn{B}}(R)}{\epsilon_{\rmn{B}}(R)+\epsilon_{\rmn{CMB}}} 
\left( \frac{\epsilon_{\rmn{B}}(R)}{\epsilon_{B_{\rmn{c}}}} \right)^{(\alpha-2)/4},
\label{eq:jnu}
\end{equation}
where the abbreviations $A_\nu$ and $\epsilon_{B_{\rmn{c}}}$ are defined in
Appendix~\ref{app:A}. $\epsilon_{\rmn{CMB}}$ is the energy density of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), and $\epsilon_B=B^{2}/(8\pi)$ denotes the magnetic
energy density. We assume a scaling of the magnetic field with gas density that
is given by
\begin{equation}
B(R) = B_0\,\left(\frac{\rho_{\rmn{gas}}(R)}{\rho_{\rmn{gas},0}}\right)^{\alpha_B},
\label{eq:B}
\end{equation}
where $B_0$ is the central magnetic field and $\alpha_{\rmn{B}}$ describes the
declining rate of the magnetic field strength toward the cluster outskirts. Such
a parametrization is suggested by cosmological simulations
\citep{2008A&A...482L..13D} as well as Faraday rotation measurements \citep[][and
references therein]{2010A&A...513A..30B, 2011A&A...529A..13K}.  The radio
surface brightness $S_{\nu}(R_{\perp})$ (in the small-angle approximation) and
luminosity $L_{\nu}$, at a given frequency $\nu$, are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
S_\nu(R_{\perp}) &=& 2 \int_{R_{\perp}}^{\infty} j_{\nu}(R) \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^{2}-R_{\perp}^{2}}} \rmn{d}R, \label{eq:surf} \\
L_{\nu}  &=&  4 \pi \int \dd V j_\nu(R).
\label{eq:lum}
\end{eqnarray}
The flux is given by $F_{\nu}=L_{\nu}/(4\pi D^{2})$ where $D$ is the luminosity
distance to the object. Note that we do not convolve $S_\nu$ with the instrumental
point spread function unless specified.

The spatial CR distribution within galaxy clusters is governed by an interplay
of advection, CR streaming and diffusion. The advection of CRs by turbulent gas
motions is dominated by the largest eddy turnover time $\tau_{\rmn{tu}}\sim
L_{\rmn{tu}}/ \vel_{\rmn{tu}}$. $L_{\rmn{tu}}$ denotes the turbulent injection
scale (typically of order the core radius) and $\vel_{\rmn{tu}}$ is the
associated turbulent velocity that gets close to the sound speed
$\vel_{\rmn{s}}$ for transsonic turbulence after a cluster merger and relaxes to
small velocities afterwards. In contrast, the crossing time of streaming CRs
over $L_{\rmn{tu}}$ is $\tau_{\rmn{st}}\sim \chi_B\,L_{\rmn{tu}}/
\vel_{\rmn{st}}$ with the streaming velocity given by $\vel_{\rmn{st}}\sim
\vel_{\rmn{s}}$ and $\chi_B\lesssim 1$ parametrizes the magnetic bending scale.
Magnetic bottlenecks for the macroscopic, diffusive CR transport, are critical
in lowering the microscopic streaming velocity of CR by some finite
factor. Therefore, we can define a turbulent propagation parameter
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gamma_tu}
  \gamma_{\rmn{tu}}\equiv\frac{\tau_{\rmn{st}}}{\tau_{\rmn{tu}}}=
  \frac{\chi_B\,\vel_{\rmn{tu}}}{\vel_{\rmn{st}}}
\end{equation}
that indicates the relative importance of advection versus CR streaming as the
dominant CR transport mechanism. After a merger, turbulent advective transport
dominates yielding $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}\gg 1$, which results in centrally enhanced
CR profiles. In contrast, in a relaxed cluster, CR streaming should be the
dominant transport mechanism implying $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}\sim1$ and producing
flat CR profiles (for a detailed discussion of these processes, see
\citealp{2011A&A...527A..99E}).

What we propose here is to keep the spectral shape of the CR distribution
function as determined from cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of clusters
\citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P}, which however did not account for CR streaming. 
Hence the spatial CR distribution has to be modified to include the effects of CR
streaming. For this reason we adopt the analytical result from
\citet{2011A&A...527A..99E}. This yields a model that includes the necessary CR
transport physics and is able to predict the radio and gamma-ray emission while
reproducing the observed RH properties. Note that this approach is not fully
self-consistent and points to the necessity of future hydrodynamical simulations
to include the effect of CR streaming and diffusion on the CR spectrum.

\caption{\emph{Left panel.} We show our hybrid model profiles for the
  normalization of the CR distribution for the NCCC and CCC cases and for
  different values of $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$. We fix the CR number for the case of
  $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$ using Equation~(36) of \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E},

  and $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$). Here, the CR profiles are normalized at
  $C_{0.1}=C(0.1R_{200})$.}
\label{fig:CRFinalModel}
\end{figure*}

To construct such a model, we have to generalize the approach proposed by
\citet{2011A&A...527A..99E} in order to account for GNFW gas profiles
(Section~\ref{sec:2.2}). We also have to include the cluster mass-scaling of the
CR normalization obtained from simulations \citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. While
details are given in Appendix~\ref{app:B}, we show below the main steps. When
turbulent advection completely dominates the CR transport, the CR normalization
can be written as \citep{2011A&A...527A..99E}
\begin{equation}
C_{\rmn{adv}}(R)=C_{0} \left( \frac{P_{\rmn{th}}(R)}{P_{\rmn{th},0}} \right)^{\frac{\beta_{\rmn{CR}}}{\gamma}} = 
C_{0} \eta(R)^{\beta_{\rmn{CR}}},
\label{eq:Csimple_1}
\end{equation} 
where $\beta_{\rmn{CR}}=(\alpha+2)/3$, $\gamma=5/3$. We introduced the
advective CR profile $\eta(R)=(P(R)/P_0)^{1/\gamma}$. Solving the continuity
equation for CRs, \citet{2011A&A...527A..99E} derive the CR density profile,
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rmn{CR}}(R) = \rho_{\rmn{CR},0} \eta(R) \rmn{exp} \left( \frac{R}{R_{*}} \right) \, ,
\label{eg:rhoCR_1}
\end{equation} 
where $R_{*}=\gamma_{\rmn{\rmn{tu}}}R_{\rmn{c}}$ and $R_{\rmn{c}}$ is the characteristic 
radius, of order the core radius, at which the turbulence is supposed to be injected.
Now, we introduce the \emph{semi-analytical} mass-dependent normalization of the
CR profile of \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} such that
\begin{equation}
\eta(R) = \left( \frac{C_{\rmn{adv}}(R)}{C_0} \right)^{1/\beta_{\rmn{CR}}} \to
\left( \frac{C_{\rmn{hybrid}}(R)}{C_0} \right)^{1/\beta_{\rmn{CR}}} \, ,
\label{eq:eta}
\end{equation} 
which effectively redefines $C_{\rmn{adv}}(R)$ by that of our hybrid model, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
C_{\rmn{hybrid}}(R) =  \tilde{C}(R)\, \frac{\rho_{\rmn{gas}}(R)}{m_\rmn{p}} \frac{T(R)}{T_0}.
\label{eq:Cf}
\end{equation} 
Here, $\tilde{C}(R)$ is the normalization CR profile of Equation~(22) of
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. We additionally account for the temperature decline
toward the cluster periphery, $T(R)$, given by the fit to the universal
temperature profile obtained from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
\citep{2007MNRAS.378..385P,2010MNRAS.409..449P} and deep {\em Chandra} X-ray
observations \citep{2005ApJ...628..655V}. Eventually, the CR profile in our
hybrid model is $C(R)=C_{0}(\rho_{\rmn{CR}}(R) /
\rho_{\rmn{CR},0})^{\beta_{\rmn{CR}}}$ within $R_{\pm}$ of
Equation~(\ref{eq:Rpm}), with $\rho_{\rmn{CR}}$ defined by
Equation~(\ref{eg:rhoCR_1}) where $C_{\rmn{hybrid}}$ enters through our
redefinition of $\eta$, and $C(R) = C(R_{\pm})$ for $R > R_{+}$ and $R < R_{-}$,
respectively.

The last step is to generalize the case of one CR population with a single
spectral index $\alpha$ to include the spectral curvature as suggested by
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. They model the CR spectrum with three different
power-law CR populations with spectral indices of
$\alpha_{i}=(2.15,2.3,2.55)$. Our formalism can be easily extended to
account for multiple CR populations by extending the terms with a single
$\alpha$ to sums over the three spectral indices (see
\citealp{2010MNRAS.409..449P}). This extension has to be applied to $A_{\nu}$,
to the factor $(\epsilon_{\rmn{B}}(R)/ \epsilon_{B_{\rmn{c}}})^{(\alpha-2)/4}$
of Equation~(\ref{eq:jnu}), and to Equation~(\ref{eq:Csimple_1}). While the
modifications are straight forward in the first two cases (and are adopted for
our hybrid model, see Appendix~\ref{app:A}), introducing a sum over $\alpha_{i}$
in Equation~(\ref{eq:Csimple_1}) would make impossible to solve analytically for
$\eta(R)$ in Equation~(\ref{eq:eta}). For simplicity, we decided to only use
$\alpha = 2.3$ in this last case.\footnote{We checked that
  the choice of $\alpha$ in Equation~(\ref{eq:Csimple_1}) has only a minor
  effect on the results. Varying $\alpha$ within $2.15-2.55$ leaves the radial
  shape and the normalization unchanged within $0.5\%$.} For the highly
turbulent cases, i.e., for $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$ (1000), we recover the radial
shape and normalization of the semi-analytical model of
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} within $1\%$ ($0.1\%$).

Summarizing, our \emph{hybrid} model for the CR distribution function, has the
following properties: it accounts for (i) the X-ray-inferred (CCC and NCCC) gas
profiles and cluster-mass scaling of the gas fraction, (ii) a cluster-mass
dependent CR normalization and universal CR spectrum as derived from
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, (iii) an effective parametrization of
active CR transport processes, including CR streaming and diffusion, which
allows us to explore different turbulent states of the clusters in our MultiDark
sample.

In the left two panels of Figure~\ref{fig:CRFinalModel}, we show our hybrid CR 
normalization for the NCCC and CCC cases and for different values of
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$.  As expected, when CR streaming is the dominant CR
transport mechanism, i.e., for negligible advective turbulent transport or
equivalently, $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}\sim1$, the spatial CR profiles are flattened
irrespective of the cluster state. While turbulence in NCCCs could be
injected by a merging (sub-)cluster, in the case of CCCs, the interaction of the
AGN jet or radio lobe with the ambient ICM could be the source of turbulence.

In the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:CRFinalModel}, we compare our hybrid model
profile with the semi-analytical advection-only case (adopting our GNFW gas
profiles and the outer temperature decrease to the model proposed by
\citealp{2010MNRAS.409..449P}) and with the exact analytical solution as in
\citet{2011A&A...527A..99E}, but for our GNFW profiles (see Appendix~\ref{app:B}
for details).  The profiles are normalized at $0.1 R_{200}$. In that case of
dominant advective CR transport, our hybrid model compares nicely with the
semi-analytical model derived from cosmological cluster simulations
\citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P}.  The main differences between our hybrid model (and
the semi-analytical model) on the one side and the analytical solution on the
other side is the inclusion of the simulation-based ``reference'' profile
$\tilde{C}$ for the advection-only case and the universally observed temperature
drop towards the outskirts of clusters. Note that the profiles in our hybrid
model are generally more centrally peaked in comparison to the analytical GNFW
case, which is due to the enhanced radiative cooling in the
\citet{2010MNRAS.409..449P} simulations that did not account for AGN
feedback. Thanks to the flexible parametrization in our model, this can be
easily counteracted by changing $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ and $\alpha_B$, however, at
the expense that these parameters are now degenerate with our assumptions on the
CR profile in the advection-dominated regime and other possible effects that we
are not considering such as cluster asphericity (see also next
Section~\ref{sec:3}).

\section{Radio Surface Brightness Modeling}
\label{sec:3}

In this Section we apply our model to reproduce the emission characteristics of
four well-observed RHs. Hence for the purpose of this section, we adopt the
measured gas and temperature profiles derived from X-ray observations of each cluster.  
Our hybrid model includes an overall normalization $g_{\rmn{CR}}$ of the CR
distribution function and the hadronically-induced non-thermal emission 
(see Appendix~\ref{app:A}). Note that
this parameter can be interpreted as a functional that depends on the
\emph{maximum CR acceleration efficiency}, $g(\zeta_{\rmn{p,max}})$,
\citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P} but \emph{only} for
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}\gtrsim100$. We will additionally study the CR-to-thermal
pressure $X_{\rmn{CR}}=P_{\rmn{CR}}/P_{\rmn{th}}$, where the CR pressure is
given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:PCR}
  P_{\rmn{CR}}=\frac{g_{\rmn{CR}} C m_{\rmn{p}} c^{2}}{6}
  \sum_{i=1}^{3} \Delta_{i} \mathcal{B}_{1/(1+q^2)} \left(
    \frac{\alpha_{i}-1}{2},\frac{3-\alpha_{i}}{2} \right).
\end{equation}
Here, $c$ is the speed of light, $q=0.8$ is the low-momentum cutoff of the CR
distribution, and the normalization factors of the individual CR populations are
given by $\Delta_{i} = (0.767, 0.143, 0.0975)$ \citep[][see also
Appendix~\ref{app:A}]{2010MNRAS.409..449P}.


\subsection{Modelling individual radio halos}

For our study, we choose the giant radio halos of Coma
\citep{1997A&A...321...55D} and Abell~2163
\citep{2001A&A...373..106F,2009A&A...499..679M}, both in merging NCCCs, and the
radio mini-halos of Perseus \citep{1990MNRAS.246..477P} and Ophiuchus
\citep{2009A&A...499..371G,2009A&A...499..679M}, both in relaxed CCCs. The radio
emission of these clusters is representative of a wide class of RHs.
Additionally, Perseus, Ophiuchus and Coma are among the most promising clusters
for gamma-ray observations \citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P,2011arXiv1105.3240P}. In
Table~\ref{tab:RadioHalos}, we summarize the main characteristics of these halos
and detail the main parameters adopted for the modeling and the corresponding
results. In Figure~\ref{fig:SBmodeling}, we show the surface brightness and
CR-to-thermal pressure profile of each cluster. We model these clusters at
1.4~GHz and within $R_{200}$.

\subsubsection{The Coma radio halo}

The giant radio halo in Coma has a morphology remarkably similar to the extended
X-ray thermal bremsstrahlung emission, although the radio emission declines more
slowly towards the cluster outskirts
\citep{1992A&A...259L..31B,1997A&A...321...55D}. Note that the morphology is
non-spherical, showing an elongation in the East-West direction.  The full-width
half maximum (FWHM) of the radio beam is $0.156$~deg
\citep{1997A&A...321...55D}, almost two orders of magnitude larger than the
X-ray observation of \cite{1992A&A...259L..31B}.\footnote{Note that the apparent
  displacement of the radio and X-ray peak of about $0.05$~deg is well
  within the angular resolution of the radio observation and hence negligible
  for the modeling.}  Thus, we apply a Gaussian smoothing to our theoretical
surface brightness of Equation~(\ref{eq:surf}) with $\sigma_{\rmn{smoothing}} =
FWHM_{\rmn{radio}}/2.355$.

We investigate different values for $\alpha_{\rmn{B}}=(0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7)$ and
for $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ ranging from 1 to 100. First, we fix the CR number for
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$ using Equation~(36) of \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} while
integrating the cluster volume within $R_{200}$. Then, we require CR number
conservation during CR streaming (for CR energies $E>$~GeV where Coulomb cooling
is negligible for CR protons), i.e., when lowering the values of
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$. Fixing the central magnetic field $B_{0}=5$~$\mu$G
\citep{2010A&A...513A..30B}, we use $g_{\rmn{CR}}$ as normalization factor to
match the radio observations. The best match to the data is obtained for
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=1$ and $\alpha_{\rmn{B}}=0.6$. Values as high as
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}} \approx 4$ can be accommodated, however, at the expense of a
shallower decline of the magnetic field profile (smaller $\alpha_B$) as a
function of cluster-centric radius. We recover the radio surface brightness
shape and the total radio luminosity within about $20\%$.

The gamma-ray flux (see Appendix~\ref{app:C}) within $R_{200}$ for the
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}} = 1$ case and for energies above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is
$F_{\gamma} = 4.1 \times 10^{-9}$ ($1.5 \times 10^{-12}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$.
Hence, it is in tension with the limit recently set by \emph{Fermi}-LAT
\citep{2012AAS...21920701Z} of $F_{\gamma, UL} (>100~\rmn{MeV}) \approx 2.5
\times 10^{-9}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$.  Note that for slightly higher values of
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$, i.e., a more centrally concentrated CR distribution, the
radio and gamma-ray yield would be increased (assuming CR number
conservation). However, in order to match the observed radio synchrotron
profiles, we have to decrease the CR normalization (parametrized by
$g_{\rmn{CR}}$). This causes the associated gamma-ray flux also to be reduced to
a level that is low enough to easily circumvent the gamma-ray constraints. In
fact, for $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}} = 4$, we obtain $F_{\gamma} (>100~\rmn{MeV}) = 9.6
\times 10^{-10}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ (and $F_{\gamma} (>100~\rmn{GeV}) = 3.6
\times 10^{-13}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$). We caution that in principle, CR streaming
should cause the CR spectrum to steepen. This may then considerably weaken these
constraints as a result of the convex spectral curvature since the gamma-ray
emission probes the high-energy tail of the CR distribution that is suppressed
in this picture in comparison to the lower-energy protons that the radio
emission is sensitive to \citep[see][for an extended discussion of this
point]{2011arXiv1111.5544M}.


\subsubsection{The radio halo in Abell~2163}

The morphology of the giant radio halo in Abell~2163 is also closely correlated
to the cluster thermal X-ray structure. As in Coma, the radio emission declines
towards the cluster outskirts at a slower rate in comparison to the thermal
X-ray emission \citep{2001A&A...373..106F}. The morphological appearance is
non-spherical, with an elongation in the East-West direction. We use the surface
brightness map provided by \citet{2009A&A...499..679M} for which the synthesized
radio beam can be approximated by a circular Gaussian with
$FWHM_{\rmn{radio}}=62\arcsec$.  Again, $FWHM_{\rmn{radio}}$ is larger than the
resolution of the \emph{ROSAT} observation and the corresponding gas density
profile. Converted to physical scale, $\sigma_{\rmn{smoothing}}$ is of the order
of that in Coma because of the larger distance of Abell~2163. Hence, we also apply
Gaussian smoothing.

We follow the same procedure as in Coma, and adopt a central magnetic field
strength of $B_{0}=5~\mu$G. The only match to the data is obtained for 
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=1$ and $\alpha_B=0.3$, i.e., the flattest possible surface 
brightness. We recover the emission shape and the total luminosity within about 
$15\%$. The corresponding gamma-ray flux within $R_{200}$ is 
$F_{\gamma} (>100~\rmn{MeV}) = 4.2 \times10^{-10}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$, 
about two orders of magnitude lower than the upper limit obtained by 
\emph{Fermi}-LAT \citep{2010ApJ...717L..71A}, and 
$F_{\gamma} (>100~\rmn{GeV}) =1.5 \times10^{-13}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$.


\subsubsection{The Perseus radio mini-halo}

The diffuse radio emission in Perseus is the best known example of a radio
mini-halo \citep{1990MNRAS.246..477P} and Perseus itself is among the best
studied clusters in X-rays
(e.g.,~\citealp{2003ApJ...590..225C,2006MNRAS.366..417F,2011arXiv1105.5025F}). Also
the Perseus radio morphology resembles that in the X-rays. We proceed as before,
but now adopt a higher central magnetic field strength of
$B_{0}=10$~$\mu$G. Such a larger $B_0$ is expected in a CCC with its higher
central gas density, implying a larger adiabatic compression factor of the
magnetic field during the condensation of the cool core (see
\citealp{2010ApJ...710..634A,2011arXiv1111.5544M} for a discussion on the
Perseus magnetic field).

The best match to the data is obtained for $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=3$ and
$\alpha_{\rmn{B}}=0.4$, however, values as high as $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}} \approx
100$, and as low as $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=2$, can be easily accommodated. We
recover the surface brightness profile and the total luminosity within $10\%$.
The gamma-ray flux within $R_{200}$ for the $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=3$ case and for
energies above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is $F_{\gamma} = 1.4 \times 10^{-8}$ ($5.1
\times 10^{-12}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. Adopting $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$ and
$\alpha_B=0.3$, the corresponding gamma-ray flux above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is
$F_{\gamma} = 4.9 \times 10^{-9}$ ($1.8 \times 10^{-12}$)
cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. Note that the gamma-ray flux above 100~MeV of the central
galaxy NGC~1275 as measured by \emph{Fermi} is $2 \times
10^{-7}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ \citep{2009arXiv0904.1904T}, well above our model
predictions due to hadronically produced diffuse gamma-ray emission that is
expected to glow from the entire cluster.

We can compare these predictions with the upper limit above 1~TeV, and for a
region within $0.15$~deg around the cluster center, recently obtained by
\cite{2011arXiv1111.5544M}. For $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=3$ ($\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$),
we obtain a flux of $F_{\gamma}(>1~\rmn{TeV},<0.15~\rmn{deg}) = 7.3 \times
10^{-14}$ ($5.5 \times 10^{-14}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$, which is well below the
upper limit of the MAGIC collaboration,
$F_{\gamma,\rmn{UL}}(>1~\rmn{TeV},<0.15~\rmn{deg}) \approx 1.4 \times
10^{-13}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. Note also that, in the case of $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}
= 100$, we obtain a maximum CR acceleration efficiency multiplier of
$g(\zeta_{\rmn{p,max}})=0.52$, about half of the value adopted by
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. Note that adopting $g(\zeta_{\rmn{p,max}})=1$
results in slightly smaller gamma-ray luminosities in comparison to those
predicted by \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} and \cite{2011arXiv1105.3240P} because
we additionally account for the central temperature dip and as well as the
decrease towards larger radii.


\subsubsection{The Ophiuchus radio mini-halo}

The Ophiuchus cluster has been widely studied both in radio and X-rays in the
last few years because of the claimed presence of a non-thermal hard X-ray tail
\citep{2008A&A...479...27E,2008PASJ...60.1133F,2009A&A...499..371G,
  2009A&A...499..679M,2009MNRAS.396.2237P,2009A&A...508.1161N,2010A&A...514A..76M,
  2010MNRAS.405.1624M}.  It was classified as a merging cluster by
\cite{2001PASJ...53..605W}, but more recently \cite{2008PASJ...60.1133F} did not
find any evidence of merging and, on the contrary, classified it as one of the
hottest clusters with a cool-core (see also \citealp{2010MNRAS.405.1624M}). The
radio mini-halo morphology displays similarities with the thermal X-ray
emission. For our modeling we use the surface brightness profile provided by
\cite{2009A&A...499..679M}.  

We proceed as before, adopting a central magnetic field value of
$B_{0}=10$~$\mu$G. The best match to the data is obtained for
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=5$ and $\alpha_B=0.7$. However, values as high as
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}} \approx 100$, and as low as $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=2$, can be
easily accommodated. We recover the surface brightness profile and the total
luminosity within $20\%$. The gamma-ray flux within $R_{200}$ for the $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=5$
case and for energies above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is $F_{\gamma} = 1.2 \times
10^{-10}$ ($4.3 \times 10^{-14}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. Adopting
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$ and $\alpha_B=0.3$, the corresponding gamma-ray flux
above 100~MeV (100~GeV) is $F_{\gamma} = 8.3 \times 10^{-11}$ ($3.1 \times
10^{-14}$) cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The gamma-ray flux is, in both cases, about two
orders of magnitude lower than the upper limit obtained by \emph{Fermi}-LAT
\citep{2010ApJ...717L..71A}. Note also that in the case of $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}} =
100$ we obtain a maximum CR acceleration efficiency multiplier of
$g(\zeta_{\rmn{p,max}})=0.014$.

%The position of radio and X-ray peaks seems displaced by about 24''. Again,
%Matteo Murgia has kindly provided the radio surface brightness computed with
%respect to the \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R} X-ray position, however the change is
%not very significant.

\subsection{Discussion and conclusions on the hybrid hadronic model}
\label{sec:discussion_hadronic}

After these detailed considerations on four individual RHs, we
are now summarizing the main points:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item The radio mini-halos in Perseus and Ophiuchus can be easily reproduced in
  our hybrid hadronic model with a wide range of possible values for
  $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$. In contrast, the large extension of the giant radio halos
  in Coma and Abell~2163 in comparison to the X-ray emission requires lower
  values of $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}\lesssim4$ in order to match the data.
  However, we would expect higher values for $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ in
  merging NCCCs that are highly turbulent \citep{2011A&A...527A..99E}.  There
  are four possibilities that can explain this apparent contradiction.  (i)
  Primary electrons accelerated in outer shocks, which we do not consider here,
  could have an important contribution to the RH emission, particularly in the
  cluster outskirts \citep{2008MNRAS.385.1211P}. While this does not have to
  significantly enhance the total luminosity, it could account for the larger
  radial extent of the radio surface brightness in comparison to the thermal
  X-ray emission. (ii) Merging clusters are not spherically symmetric as can be
  seen in Coma and Abell~2163, requiring inherently non-spherical modelling. In
  order to reproduce the more extended radio emission relative to the thermal
  X-ray emission, the non-thermal clumping factor, $C_{\rmn{non-th}}$, needs to
  be larger than its thermal analogue, $C_{\rmn{th}}$, in concentric spherical
  shells, where we defined those statistics by
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:clumping}
    C_{\rmn{non-th}} &=&
    \expval{\rho_\rmn{gas} C}/\expval{\sqrt{\rho_\rmn{gas} C}}^2,\\
    C_{\rmn{th}} &=& 
    \expval{\rho_\rmn{gas}^2}/\expval{\rho_\rmn{gas}}^2.
  \end{eqnarray}
  This appears to be the case since the radio surface brightness emission is
  more elongated than its counterpart in thermal X-rays and needs to be
  carefully quantified in future work. (iii) CR streaming and diffusive
  transport may cause a possible spectral steepening in the cluster core region
  that would imply spatial variations of the CR spectral index throughout the
  cluster and hence a spatially varying radio emission, in particular in the
  cluster outskirts.  (iv) Adopting the simulation-derived $\tilde{C}$ profile
  \citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P} for our hybrid model may have biased the inner
  slope of the CR density profile to become too steep due to the overcooling
  problem of purely radiative simulations. This produces cluster cores that are
  too dense (in comparison to observations), which also should overestimate the
  rate of adiabatic compression that is experienced by the CR population during
  the formation of the cooling core. Hence, the resulting values of
  $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ are then biased low in comparison to a potentially
  shallower slope of the inner CR profile. To quantify the last point, we try to
  reproduce the Coma surface brightness using a model without $\tilde{C}$. We find that
  values as high as $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}} \approx 8$ can be accommodated. However,
  $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=1$ still represents the best match to the data, demonstrating that
  the problem can be weakened but not circumvented even in this case of a cored
  CR profile. Nevertheless, we can successfully reproduce the morphology of Coma
  and Abell~2163 RHs, solving the previous problems of the \emph{classical}
  hadronic model (see, e.g., \citealp{2010MNRAS.401...47D,2012arXiv1207.3025B}).
\item Gamma-ray and radio emission are complementary tools in constraining the
  CR population. While gamma-ray emission is a direct way to constrain the CR
  pressure, it is also critical in disentangling between the hadronic and
  re-acceleration model. In contrast, the information derived from the radio
  window is degenerate with the assumptions on the magnetic field
  strengths. Nevertheless, we find that RH measurements allow tighter constraints
  on the CR pressure (except for the case of Coma). 
\item The magnetic field values adopted here are perfectly in agreement with
  other observational constraints, solving previous tensions of the
  \emph{classical} hadronic model (see,
  e.g., \citealp{2011ApJ...728...53J,2012arXiv1207.3025B}). Indeed, different values 
  of $B_{0}$ could be adopted without violating other observational constraints. The exception 
  to this is again Coma, for which a higher $B_{0}$ value would be in contradiction
  with Faraday rotation measure data \citep{2010A&A...513A..30B}, leaving room
  for central magnetic field strengths around 1--5~$\mu$G that are in agreement
  with the data. Only a value much lower would imply a level of the gamma-ray
  emission that challenges the most recent {\em Fermi} limit
  \citep{2012AAS...21920701Z}.
\item Considering the case of advection-dominated CR transport
  ($\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}\gtrsim100$), which only allows for a good match to the
  data of Perseus and Ophiuchus, the $g_{\rmn{CR}}$ parameter can be
  interpreted as the maximum CR acceleration efficiency used in
  \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. If the cluster CR population is mainly accelerated
  in cosmological structure formation shocks, then this value should depend on
  the mass accretion history and should be approximately universal, i.e., similar for
  all clusters. We find $g_{\rmn{CR, Perseus}} = 0.52$ and $g_{\rmn{CR,
      Ophiuchus}} = 0.014$, because we fixed $B_{0}=10$~$\mu$G in both cases and
  used $g_{\rmn{CR}}$ as normalization. This discrepancy can be resolved by
  increasing/lowering the central magnetic field in Perseus/Ophiuchus to
  $B_{0,\rmn{Perseus}}=20$~$\mu$G and $B_{0,\rmn{Ophiuchus}}=1$~$\mu$G. We note,
  however, that without the guidance of cosmological cluster simulations that
  include CR streaming, the data does not yet constrain $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$.
\item The small cluster sample analysed here was only meant to serve as a proof
  of concept and to demonstrate the viability of matching observed RH data with
  our hybrid hadronic model. This is in especially true because of the
  comparably large parameter space that the physics modeled here demands and
  which encompasses our parametrization of the magnetic field ($B_0$,
  $\alpha_B$), $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$, and the CR acceleration efficiency
  function. Particularly, a large region of the ($\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$,
  $\alpha_{\rmn{B}}$) parameter space is available for the analyzed radio
  mini-halos (note also that the parameters $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ and
  $\alpha_{\rmn{B}}$ are degenerate). Future work on all known RHs may provide
  better insight, but is beyond the scope of this work.
\end{enumerate}
Summarizing, we find that the hybrid hadronic model that includes microscopic CR
transport successfully reproduces the main morphological characteristics of both
giant and mini-halos without violating gamma-ray constraints. As we will see in
the next section, it can also reproduce the radio-to-X-ray scaling relation,
solving the previous problems of the \emph{classical} hadronic model, and the
radio-to-SZ scaling relation.

\section{Radio Scaling Relations}
\label{sec:4}
As introduced in Section~\ref{sec:1}, there exist an apparent bimodality between
the radio and X-ray cluster emission. Clusters with a given X-ray luminosity can
either host RHs or show an absence of diffuse radio emission
(see, e.g., \citealp{2009A&A...507..661B,2011A&A...527A..99E}). More recently, a study
of the radio-to-SZ scaling relation revealed the absence of a strong bimodality
dividing the cluster population into radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters
\citep{2012MNRAS.421L.112B}. Since $Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ correlates more tightly with
cluster mass than $L_{\rmn{X}}$, this may indicate that the larger scatter
of $L_{\rmn{X}}$ correlates with the scatter of the radio luminosity in such a way that
it produces a bimodality; but as a result of a second (hidden parameter) rather
than the fundamental cluster parameter -- its mass. In this section, we
investigate these two scaling relations in the framework of our extended
hadronic scenario.


\subsection{Exploring the parameter space of scaling relations}

In Figure~\ref{fig:SR}, we show the general scaling relations of our hybrid CR
model of Section~\ref{sec:2.3} applied to the MultiDark sample. We show how both
the radio-to-X-ray and the radio-to-SZ scaling relations differ upon varying the
parameters $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$, $B_{0}$, $\alpha_{\rmn{B}}$ and redshift. We fix
the CR-normalization parameter $g_{\rmn{CR}}$ to 0.5 in all cases, ensuring an
average CR-to-thermal pressure of $2\%$ ($0.05\%$) within $R_{500}$
($R_{500}/2$). Here, the radio luminosity is calculated at $1.4$~GHz within
$R_{500}.$\footnote{The mean (median) difference between calculating $L_{\nu}$
  within $R_{200}$ or $R_{500}$ is 5.3\% (5.6\%).}  In our CR model, we fix the
CR number for $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$ using Equation~(36) of
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}, integrating up to $R_{500}$. To compute the radio
luminosity for different values of $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$, we employ CR number
conservation (for CR energies $E>$~GeV where Coulomb cooling is negligible for CR
protons).

In each panel in Figure~\ref{fig:SR} there are two separated populations for
each model realization (i.e., for a given set of parameters). Each upper set of
points corresponds to the CCC population while the lower set corresponds to
NCCCs, respectively. In our model, the radio and X-ray emissivities scale with
the square of the gas density so that $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}$ and $L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$
are significantly higher for CCCs in comparison to NCCCs. In contrast,
$Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ only depends weakly on the central gas density as explained in
Section~\ref{sec:X-SZ-scaling}. This explains the relative location of the NCCC and
CCC populations in the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ and
$L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ planes. In particular, CCCs are shifted to the
upper right in the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ plane while they are
shifted vertically upward in the plane spanned by
$L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$. In reality, we expect an (ab initio unknown)
distribution of these parameters which would substantially increase the scatter
in the scaling relations and possibly lead to a bimodality, depending on
correlations among the different parameters.

Most interestingly, the slope of the radio scaling relations does not differ
when varying parameter values because we do not include any cluster
mass-dependence in our parametrizations which is neither required nor
constrained by current data. Closely inspecting Figure~\ref{fig:SR}, we see that
we obtain the largest changes in $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}$ for variations in
$1<\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}<5$ and $B_0$ over the parameter range probed, albeit with a
stronger dependence for weaker field strengths (as expected from
Equation~\ref{eq:jnu}).


\subsection{Comparison to observations}
\label{sec:scaling-obs}

\begin{figure*}[t]

\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/PL_relation.eps}
\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/PSZ_relation.eps}
\caption{Radio-to-X-ray and radio-to-SZ scaling relations in our hybrid CR model
  (see main text for the details of the chosen parameters) compared with
  observations.  \emph{Left.} $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ relation in
  comparison to the observational sample taken from the literature and detailed
  in Appendix~\ref{app:D}. \emph{Right.} $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$
  relation in comparison to the observational sample C07 from
  \cite{2012MNRAS.421L.112B}.}
\label{fig:PLSZ}
\end{figure*} 
 
After collecting the X-ray luminosity and the SZ flux of known RHs, we compare
the resulting scaling relations to a phenomenological model realization that was
chosen to additionally obey other observational constraints (e.g., from Faraday
rotation studies) as well as theoretical considerations on CR transport.


\subsubsection{Observational samples}

In Appendix~\ref{app:D} we construct a sample of giant radio halos (black) and
radio mini-halos (red), as well as upper limits on the radio emission
\citep{2009A&A...507..661B, 2011A&A...527A..99E, 2009A&A...499..371G}, and show
this in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}. The median redshift of this
sample is $z\approx0.18$. The corresponding observational scaling relation is
well fit by $\log_{10} L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}} = A + B~\log_{10} L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ with
$A=-50.433\pm2.226$ and $B=1.803\pm0.049$, and a scatter of $\sigma_{yx} \approx
0.44$ (we do not include upper limits in the fit; units are as in
Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}). We refer the reader to \cite{2009A&A...507..661B} and
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} for an extensive discussion on this topic. We
emphasize that in contrast to giant radio halos, mini-halos span a wider range
in radio luminosity (as also pointed out by \citealp{2009A&A...499..679M}). The
Perseus mini-halo (highest radio mini-halo luminosity in the left panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}), e.g., has a radio luminosity that is almost an order of
magnitude higher than in giant radio halos at the same X-ray luminosity. In
contrast, the Ophiuchus mini-halo (lowest radio mini-halo luminosity in the left
panel of Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}), which is representative of a few other similar
examples recently detected in CCCs (such as A2029 and A1835), has a radio
luminosity which is much lower than giant radio halos in merging clusters and is
even below the upper limits.

We caution that the determination of the slope of the observational
$L_{1.4}-L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ relation is not very robust because of the small
sample size of RHs, selection biases of extended low-surface brightness objects,
and systematic uncertainties in the measurements of $L_{1.4}$ and
$L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$. The recently detected low-luminosity mini-halos exemplify
those uncertainties and the large intrinsic scatter of this relation. On the
other hand, X-ray luminosities for the same object as derived by,
e.g.,~\emph{ROSAT} and \emph{Chandra} can easily differ by a factor of a
few.\footnote{For example, the bolometric X-ray luminosity of A~2163 as measured
  by \emph{ROSAT} is $8.65\times10^{45}$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~erg~s$^{-1}$
  \citep{2009A&A...507..661B} while the \emph{Chandra} measurement is
  $4.93\times10^{45}$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ (\citealp{2009ApJS..182...12C};
  ACCEPT: Archive of Chandra Cluster Entropy Profile Tables;
  http://www.pa.msu.edu/astro/MC2/accept/).}  In the left panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}, we additionally show the model of
\citet{2009JCAP...09..024K} with a slope of $\approx1.2$, arbitrarily normalized
for visual purposes, from their simple analytical hadronic model.

In order to compare our model to the observed 1.4~GHz radio-to-SZ scaling
relation, we use the result by \cite{2012MNRAS.421L.112B} that is based on the
radio halo sample from \cite{2007MNRAS.378.1565C} (hereafter C07), which has a
median redshift of $z \approx 0.18$ and excludes radio mini-halos. For this
sample, \cite{2012MNRAS.421L.112B} computes $Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ within the radio-halo
radii given by \cite{2007MNRAS.378.1565C}. These radii have a median of about
$0.5$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~Mpc which compares favourably with the median of $R_{500}
\approx 0.4$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~Mpc in our MultiDark $z = 0.2$ snapshot. For the C07
sample, \cite{2012MNRAS.421L.112B} obtains a scaling relation in the form of
$\log_{10} L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}} = A + B~\log_{10} Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ with $A=29.7\pm0.8$
and $B=1.17\pm0.18$, and a scatter of $\sigma_{yx} \approx 0.28$ (units are as
in Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}). The same comments regarding the small sample size of
RHs, selection biases, and systematic uncertainties in the luminosity
measurements also apply here.


\subsubsection{Model realization}

In order to compare our model prediction with observations, we select a
particular realization of our model. To this end, we use the MultiDark cluster
sample at $z=0.2$, which compares well with the redshift of the observational
samples; see above and Appendix~\ref{app:D}. We divide our cluster sample
randomly into radio-quiet and radio-loud clusters, assuming a ratio of $10\%$ of
the latter. We use the turbulent propagation parameter $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ to
separate both populations. In radio-quiet clusters, we assign
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=1$, and in radio-loud clusters, we adopt randomly and
uniformly $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ values in the intervals $[40,80]$ and $[1,5]$ for
NCCCs and CCCs, respectively. We note that those values for $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$
would produce slightly too concentrated surface brightness profiles for giant
radio halos. As laid out in detail in Section~\ref{sec:discussion_hadronic},
this may be an artifact caused by a combination of four effects, namely
additional primary radio emission in the cluster periphery, an enhanced
non-thermal clumping factor, spatial variations of the CR spectral index, and
our choice of simulation-derived CR profiles that may be too concentrated as a
result of the overcooling in radiative simulations without AGN
feedback. Moreover, we demonstrate in Figure~\ref{fig:SR} that the normalization
of the RH luminosity is highly degenerate with our other parameters so that a
different combination of those could mimic a similar normalization for smaller
values of $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$.

Our modeling of magnetic fields is inspired by Faraday rotation studies that
point to higher field values in the core region of CCCs compared to NCCCs
\citep{2011A&A...529A..13K, 2010A&A...513A..30B}, presumably due to the higher
adiabatic compression factor during the formation of the cooling core. Hence,
for radio-quiet clusters, we adopt randomly and uniformly distributed values of
the central magnetic field $B_0$ in the intervals $[2.5,5.5]$~$\mu$G and
$[5,10]$~$\mu$G for NCCCs and CCCs, respectively. To account for the potential
turbulent dynamo in radio-loud objects (characterized by a higher turbulent
transport parameter in our model), we slightly increase $B_0$ in those objects
and chose $B_0$ intervals of $[4.5,7.5]$~$\mu$G and $[7.5,12.5]$~$\mu$G for
NCCCs and CCCs, respectively.

We fix $\alpha_{\rmn{B}}=0.5$ and $g_{\rmn{CR}}=0.5$ for all clusters. We note
that our parameter choices are mostly phenomenologically driven with the aim to
reproduce observations. The parameter study in Figure~\ref{fig:SR} exemplifies
considerable degeneracies so that different combinations of parameters can
potentially result in very similar distributions. We emphasize the need of more
detailed observations of radio halos and in particular of multi-frequency
correlation studies to constrain the interplay of some of these parameters.

In Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}, we show our model in comparison to the observed
radio-to-X-ray and radio-to-SZ scaling relations. The normalization of our model
can be arbitrarily varied by changing $g_{\rmn{CR}}$ as long as the resulting
$X_{\rmn{CR}}$ respects the current observational constraints
(see, e.g., \citealp{2011arXiv1111.5544M}) and remains below a few percents. As
explained above, our choice of $g_{CR}=0.5$ ensures an average CR-to-thermal
pressure of $2\%$ within $R_{500}$, allowing for plenty of available parameter
space to match the observational constraints.  Our model is sufficiently
flexible to either mimic a cluster radio bimodality or not, depending on the
parameters adopted for the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet
objects. 

However, with the given model realization as in Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}, the
separation of the radio-loud and radio-quiet populations is substantially larger in
the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ plane than in the
$L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ plane, which exhibits almost a continuum
distribution from radio-loud CCCs to the radio-quiet NCCCs. This is mainly
because the bolometric X-ray emissivity scales with $\rho_{\rmn{gas}}^2$ while
$Y_{\rmn{SZ}}\propto\rho_{\rmn{gas}}$ (which is only strictly valid for an
isothermal gas distribution). As a consequence, the highly peaked gas profiles
of CCCs have less impact on $Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ than on $L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$. This is
one plausible explanation for the observed discrepancy of the presence of a
bimodality in $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ and the apparent absence of it
in $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$. 

The slope of our model depends on the different parameter choices and,
particularly, on the relative differences introduced for the NCCC/CCC and the
radio-loud/quiet populations. However, we note that our
$L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ is slightly shallower than the observed
relation, more similar to the \cite{2009JCAP...09..024K} prediction, and that
the slope of our $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ compares well with the
observed slope. Owing to the many uncertainties and lack of robustness both in
the observations and modeling at this stage, we do not attempt to fine-tune our
model to the observations.

In Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4}, we show the RH luminosity function (RLF) at 1.4~GHz
for a representative realization of our hybrid CR model (as in
Section~\ref{sec:4}), and compare it with observational results. As for the XLF,
the RLF is completely determined by the cluster mass function and the radio
luminosity-to-mass relation, through $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{ \rmn{X,bol}}$ or
$L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ in combination with our phenomenological gas
model. However, in the radio band there is the additional uncertainty of the
fraction of radio-loud clusters. Thus, in Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4}, we also show
the RLFs obtained by applying the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ and
$L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ relations to simulated clusters of the
MultiDark snapshot at $z = 0.2$, using our phenomenological gas model for
$L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ and $Y_{\rmn{SZ}, 500}$ of each cluster, respectively. Note
that this procedure is {\em only} applied to halos defined as radio-loud
clusters (which are by definition accounted for in the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}$
scaling relations) and we assume a fraction of 100\%, 25\%, 10\%, 5\% and 1\% of
radio-loud clusters. As evident from Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4}, this is different
from our model for the radio luminosity, where we also define a fraction of
radio-loud clusters. However, the radio-quiet population also contributes to the
RLF with an increasing fraction at low luminosities. This is exemplified in the
top left plot of Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4}, which shows the contribution of
radio-quiet and loud populations to the total RLF, assuming a fraction of $25\%$
and $1\%$ of radio-loud objects.

In Appendix~\ref{app:D}, we make an attempt to construct an RLF from existing
X-ray flux-limited radio surveys. There exist two such studies, the cluster
radio survey done with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very
Large Array (VLA) sky survey (NVSS) at $1.4$~GHz of \cite{1999NewA....4..141G}
and the survey with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at $610$~MHz by
\cite{VenturiGMRT_1,VenturiGMRT_2}. For the latter, one can also construct an RLF
at 1.4~GHz using the corresponding RH follow-up measurements. The fractions of
radio-loud clusters are about 6\%, 18\% and 24\% for the NVSS 1.4~GHz, GMRT
610~MHz and GMRT 1.4~GHz samples, respectively. As explained in
Appendix~\ref{app:D}, we use the 1.4~GHz NVSS RLF (with a median redshift of $z
\approx 0.18$) as observational reference for our comparisons. We conclude that
the observational determinations of the RLF is not very robust at this stage;
the very different fractions of radio-loud clusters found in the different
studies is one indicator of this.
  
Generally, there is fair agreement between the NVSS RLF and both our modeled RLF
and the RLFs based on observational scaling relations, particularly for radio-loud 
fractions between 10\% and 1\%. In particular, we verified that the cumulative 
number of RHs above a certain flux limit of the NVSS survey is well matched 
by our 10\%-loud fraction case, which will be used in the following section. 
The RLF obtained from the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ relation differs from the 
NVSS RLF at high luminosities, presumably caused by the large observed scatter. 
On the other side, the RLF obtained from the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$ relation
matches the NVSS result better. These results need to be consolidated by RLFs
corrected for flux-incompleteness and simulations of larger cosmological volumes
that are more complete at the high-mass end. Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4} shows that
it will be difficult to discriminate between different scenarios at high radio
luminosities (or equivalently masses). Indeed, in the bottom right panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4} we compare our RLF and the RLFs based on observational
scaling relations for a 10\% fraction of radio-loud clusters to the NVSS
RLF. This suggests that the low-luminosity (low-mass) clusters will be the most
useful in disentangling between different models. This emphasizes the importance
of conducting homogeneous, well controlled surveys of radio halos with the
extended VLA at 1.4 GHz and LOFAR at lower frequencies. Since the latter has
already started to take data, it is extremely timely to present RLF predictions
for this wavelength regime in our model, which we will do next.


\subsection{Low-frequency predictions at 120~MHz}

In Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120}, we show our model predictions at 120~MHz obtained
with the same representative realization of our model as in Section~\ref{sec:4},
with 10\% radio-loud clusters. We show both the differential RLF (top left
panel) and the cumulative number density (bottom left panel) at different
redshifts (corresponding to different MultiDark snapshots of Table~1). We note
that our imposed mass cutoff of $M_{200}=10^{14}\,h^{-1}\,M_\odot$, which has
been adopted to reliably model the cluster gas distribution, translates into a
luminosity cutoff. This causes the differential luminosity function to turn over
at the low-luminosity end and may artificially flatten the slope already at
sightly higher luminosities than the luminosity maximum that indicates our formal
incompleteness limit.

Additionally shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120} is the expected LOFAR Tier~1
\emph{point-source} flux limit of $F_{5\sigma}^{\rmn{PS}}=0.5$~mJy
\citep{2012JApA..tmp...34R} converted to a luminosity limit at a few representative
redshifts. This flux limit is clearly an underestimate for nearby RHs, which
extend over angular scales $\sim1$~deg, as e.g., in the case of the Coma radio
halo. In order to make more reliable predictions, in the following, we will
calculate the RH flux limit with Equation~(10) of \cite{2010A&A...509A..68C},
approximating the halo extension by $R_{500}$ and requiring the mean flux within
the RH half-radius to be higher than $F_{5\sigma}^{\rmn{PS}}$. This may result
in an overestimation of the flux limit for CCCs, whose radio emission is more
centrally concentrated than in NCCCs. The median $R_{500}$ of our sample is
about $0.4$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~Mpc at all redshifts. This translates to a flux limit
of about $30$~mJy at $z = 0.1$, $7$~mJy at $z = 0.2$ and $0.5$~mJy (equal to the
point-source value) at $z \approx 0.6$.

\label{fig:RLF_120_flux}
\end{figure*}

To derive low-frequency flux functions, we construct an analytical model for the
evolving RLF. We fit the 120~MHz RLF at different redshifts with a second-order
polynomial of the form $\log_{10} \rmn{d}n/\rmn{d}L_{120~\rmn{MHz}} = A_{0} +
A_{1}~\log_{10} L_{120~\rmn{MHz}} + A_{2}~(\log_{10} L_{120~\rmn{MHz}})^{2}$.
All luminosities are measured in units of $h_{70}^{-2}
\rmn{erg~s}^{-1}\,\rmn{Hz}^{-1}$ and (comoving) number densities in units of
$h_{70}^{3}\,\rmn{Mpc}^{-3}$. We consider only luminosities with $\log_{10}
L_{120~\rmn{MHz}} \geq 29.25$ to exclude the turn-over at low luminosities
caused by incompleteness. To obtain an analytical model for $n(L,z)$, we
constrain the evolution of the three free parameters $A_i$ to follow a linear
function in $1+z$, i.e., $A_{i} = A_{i,0} + A_{i,1}~(1+z)$.\footnote{The values
  of these parameters are $A_{0,0} = -436.79$, $A_{0,1} = 109.75$, $A_{1,0} =
  29.68$, $A_{1,1} = -7.17$, $A_{2,0} = -0.51$ and $A_{2,1}$ = 0.12.} In the
right panels of Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120}, we compare the RLF fits (top) and the
cumulative number density in the simulation (bottom) to the analytical model. In
particular the analytics matches the simulation well except for high
luminosities and high redshifts where small number statistics explains the
deviations.

This analytical model describes the number of RHs expected in our model per unit
luminosity and per unit comoving volume $V_{\rmn{c}}$, i.e., $\rmn{d}^2N(L,z)
/\rmn{d}V_{\rmn{c}}\rmn{d}L$. Hence the cumulative number of RHs above a given flux
limit $F$ is given by the integral
\begin{equation}
N(>F)  =  \int_{z_1}^{z_2} \int_{L(F)}^{\infty} 
\frac{\rmn{d}^2N(L,z)}{\rmn{d}V_{\rmn{c}}\rmn{d}L}\,
\frac{\rmn{d}V_{\rmn{c}}}{\rmn{d}z}\, \rmn{d}z\, \rmn{d}L ,
\label{eq:NtotRH}
\end{equation}
where $L(F) = 4 \pi D(z)^2 F$ and $D(z)$ is the luminosity distance to an RH at
redshift $z$.  The result is shown in the left panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120_flux} for the model realization described in
Section~\ref{sec:4} with a 10\% fraction of radio-loud clusters (black solid
line). We limit the integral to luminosities $\log_{10} L_{120~\rmn{MHz}}
\geq 29.25$. Our redshift integration extends from $z_{1} = 0.018$, the redshift
of the closest known RH in Perseus, to $z_{2} = 2$. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120_flux}, already redshifts $z\gtrsim1$ do not
significantly contribute to the flux function. Additionally, there are large
theoretical uncertainties since our gas model is not calibrated for these
redshifts (and implied low-mass range) and very little is observationally known
about diffuse radio emission on group scales in particularly at these redshifts,
which motivates our upper redshift limit.

Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120_flux} shows the contribution of different redshift
slices to the total flux function. We contrast this to the flux function using
\emph{only} the subsample of 10\% radio-loud clusters (black dashed line). This
was obtained by constructing the corresponding RLF and repeating the steps above
in building an analytical model, however, discarding luminosities $\log_{10}
L_{120~\rmn{MHz}} \leq 30.75$ in the integration.

In the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_120_flux}, we show the total number of
RHs that would be \emph{detectable} by the LOFAR Tier~1 survey, where its sky
coverage (of about half the entire sky) and the signal degradation due to source
extensions of close-by RHs is taken into account. The latter is calculated with
Equation~(\ref{eq:NtotRH}) and adopting $F = F_{\rmn{min}}$ where
$F_{\rmn{min}}$ is given by Equation~(10) of \cite{2010A&A...509A..68C} as
explained above. We clip the flux limit for sufficiently distant RHs at the
point-source flux limit $F_{5\sigma}^{\rmn{PS}}$, i.e., for RHs at $z > 0.6$ we
fix $F_{\rmn{min}} = 0.5$~mJy.

The LOFAR Tier~1 survey at 120~MHz should be able to detect a total of about
$3500$ clusters hosting RHs above 0.5~mJy. The precise number of detections
depends strongly on the underlying assumptions. There are two main uncertainties
in our model: the fraction of radio-loud to radio-quiet clusters and the
corresponding luminosities as well as our assumed RH modeling in low-mass
clusters (which are not yet known to host RHs). The fraction of radio-loud to
radio-quiet clusters is determined from a given (degenerate) set of model
parameters that include $\gamma_{\rmn{th}}$, $B_{0}$, $\alpha_{B}$,
$g_{\rmn{CR}}$, or equivalently $X_{CR}$. The fraction of radio-loud clusters
mostly affects the number of medium-to-high luminosity RHs (as can be seen from
the 1.4~GHz RLFs in the top left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:RLF_1.4}). The total
number of RHs is dominated by low-luminosity RHs. While this may suggest that
the radio-loud fraction is of minor importance for the detectable numbers,
instead the opposite is the case. Because of the fixed flux limit, only the most
luminous clusters at each redshift are observable so that the total number of
detectable RHs scales almost linearly with the radio-loud fraction.

%We asses the second uncertainty by comparing
%the total result of our model (black solid line) with the RLF obtained only from
%the radio-loud population (black dashed line). Their difference somehow shows
%the uncertainty in the modeling for a fixed fraction of radio-loud clusters as
%all the configuration between the solid and dashed lines can be virtually
%realized changing the relative normalization of the loud and quiet populations.

We caution that our predicted total number of (detectable) RHs depends on the
ability to extrapolate the observed and modeled scalings down to our adopted
mass limit of $M_{200}\approx1.4\times10^{14}$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}$. If the
underlying physics imprinted a characteristic scale into the CR transport or
magnetic field distribution, this would manifest itself as a break in the radio
luminosity scaling relations and dramatically reduce (or even increase) the
number of expected RHs.  While this does not interfere with previous
(high-frequency) measurements at high luminosities, this may of critical
importance for future, more sensitive (low-frequency) measurements of
low-redshift clusters that probe the uncertain regime of diffuse radio emission
in low-mass clusters.

The reason for this lies in the steep halo mass function which ensures that that
clusters above a given cutoff (that is either physically motivated or
observationally realized through a survey flux limit) dominate the total number
of (detectable) RHs. Only if the radio luminosity scaling remains unaltered
below the survey flux limit, the steepness of the mass function ensures that
there will be more RHs scattered above the flux limit then below it. This is the
so-called Eddington bias that causes the inferred luminosities based on only the
detected sources to end up as an overestimate. Hence the presence of any
hypothetical break in the radio luminosity scaling, which is unconstrained by
current data, explains the largely varying model predictions in the recent
literature, which vary from a few to hundreds observable RHs
\citep{2010A&A...509A..68C,2011arXiv1110.2786S} to thousands of detectable RHs
in future surveys \citep{2002A&A...396...83E}.

Another relevant issue in such surveys is the identification of RHs and their
hosting clusters (see also \citealp{2010A&A...509A..68C}). RHs constitute a
small part of the entire (diffuse as well as apparent point-like) radio source
population and therefore need to be distinguished from the emission produced by
other sources. A good approach will be to cross-correlate the radio maps with
high-sensitivity X-ray surveys such as that by the future eROSITA mission, which
is expected to detect around $10^{5}$ clusters up to redshift $z \approx 1.3$
(see, e.g., \citealp{2011MSAIS..17..159C}).

Our results show the prospects of the LOFAR survey and other future radio
instruments in determining the properties over a broad range of RH luminosities
(at low frequencies). In particular, it should permit a robust determination of
the number of clusters hosting RHs at a given luminosity (mass) and to carefully
asses completeness issues. This will be extremely helpful in elucidating the RH
generation mechanism and in determining the viable parameter space for the
hadronic model.


%We additionally shown the two total results scaled down by a $50\%$ to roughly mimic an eventual RH redshift evolution as a consequence of a higher inverse Compton energy loss on the CMB for higher redshift (\citealp{2002A&A...396...83E}; this is somehow conservative as most of our cluster magnetic fields are comparable or higher than the CMB magnetic field).

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:6}
We present a detailed model for the population of RHs in galaxy clusters 
assuming that the radio-emitting electrons are generated through hadronic CR 
interactions with thermal protons of the ICM. We improve over previous works by
phenomenologically exploring the interplay of advective and streaming CR
transport in modeling the surface brightness emission, RH scaling relations and
luminosity functions. We confirm the theoretical ideas suggested by
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} and explicitly demonstrate that the inclusion of CR
streaming is necessary to solve the problems of the ``classical'' scenario of
radio halos, namely the large extents of giant radio halos in comparison to the
thermal X-ray emission and the bimodality of radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters
at a fixed X-ray luminosity.

To this end, we use a complete cosmological sample of galaxy clusters selected
from the MultiDark $N$-body simulation \citep{2011arXiv1104.5130P} with redshifts 
ranging from $z = 0$ to 1. In a next step, we construct a \emph{phenomenological} model
for the cluster-gas distribution. This is characterized by X-ray-inferred (CCC
and NCCC) gas profiles \citep[taken from the REXCESS sample,][]{2008A&A...487..431C} 
and a cluster-mass-dependent gas fraction \citep{2009ApJ...693.1142S}. 
We assign such a (cluster mass-dependent) gas density profile to each DM 
halo in our sample and sort it into the NCCC/CCC populations according to a
dynamical disturbance parameter that is calculated from the DM distribution.
With this model, we obtain a cosmologically complete mock catalog of galaxy
clusters that matches the observed $L_{\rmn{X, bol}}$-to-$M_{500}$,
$Y_{\rmn{X}}$-to-$M_{500}$, and $Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$-to-$M_{500}$ relations, as well
as the X-ray luminosity function.

%and employ seven
%snapshots from $z = 0$ up to $z = 1$. We select all DM halos with a mass above
%$M_{200}\approx1.4\times10^{14}$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}$.

We then construct a new \emph{hybrid} model for the CR distribution in clusters
and combine previous results from cosmological simulations and analytical works.
We adopt the universal spatial and spectral CR distribution found in
hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of cluster formation
\citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P}, which only account for macroscopic, advective CR
transport. Hence, we supplement this model with the approach of
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} that includes the treatment of microscopic CR
transport processes. While turbulently-driven CR advection can lead to centrally
enhanced CR profiles, CR propagation in the form of CR streaming and diffusion
produces flatter CR profiles, which should be realized for decaying cluster
turbulence. In our model, we introduce a CR propagation parameter
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ that is the ratio of the CR streaming-to-advection time
scale. This parameter allows us to effectively switch the regimes where either
process dominates the CR transport and to explore different turbulent states of
the clusters.

This enables us to model the radio surface brightness profiles of giant radio
halos (as exemplified in Coma and Abell~2163) as well as of radio mini-halos (in
Perseus and Ophiuchus) at 1.4~GHz. We demonstrate that our hybrid CR model can
successfully reproduce the radio profiles over the entire extents of giant and
mini radio-halos, solving the problems of the \emph{classical} hadronic
model. We recover the total radio luminosity within 20\% for magnetic field
configurations favored by Faraday rotation measurements. Our modeling shows that
within the parameter ranges that provide acceptable matches to the radio
profiles, the resulting gamma-ray emission from the decay of neutral pions---an
inevitable by-product in hadronic CR interactions---is well below observational
gamma-ray upper limits provided by {\em Fermi} and imaging atmospheric Cherenkov
telescopes.  Future and more sensitive gamma-ray observations, with, e.g., the
planned Cherenkov Telescope Array, may in principle be able to disentangle the
two competing models for RHs, the hadronic and re-acceleration scenarios.

While we can get excellent matches to the surface brightness of radio mini halos
for a range of our CR propagation parameter of
$2\lesssim\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}\lesssim100$, in the case of giant radio halos, our
model prefers lower values of $1\lesssim\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}\lesssim4$. However, the
morphological disturbances in the X-ray and radio maps strongly suggest a highly
turbulent state of the ICM in those clusters that host giant radio halos. We
discuss that a combination of four effects could artificially lower the inferred
values of $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$: (i) additional radio emission of primary,
shock-accelerated electrons in the cluster periphery of these mergers, (ii) an
enhanced non-thermal clumping factor in comparison to the thermal clumping
factor as suggested by the larger anisotropy of the radio emission (relative to
the X-ray emission maps), (iii) a possible spectral steepening in the cluster
core region due to CR streaming and diffusive transport that could cause spatial
variations of the CR spectral index throughout the cluster and hence a spatially
varying radio emission, in particular in the cluster outskirts, and (iv) our
choice of simulation-derived CR profiles that may be too concentrated as a
result of the overcooling in radiative simulations without AGN feedback.

We select a representative realization of our CR model and compare it with
existing radio scaling relations.  Because of CR streaming transport and the
different gas-density scalings of the X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rmn{X}}\propto\int
\rho_\rmn{gas}^2 \dd V$, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, $Y\propto\int
\rho_{\rmn{gas}} k_{\rmn{B}} T \dd V$, our model is able to simultaneously
reproduce the observed bimodality of radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters at the
same $L_{\rmn{X}}$ \citep{2009A&A...507..661B,2011A&A...527A..99E} as well as
the unimodal distribution of radio-halo luminosity versus $Y$
\citep{2012MNRAS.421L.112B}; thereby suggesting a physical solution to this
apparent contradiction. We caution however, that some parameters in our model
are degenerate with respect to the resulting radio luminosity and radio emission
profiles, in particular $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ and $\alpha_B$ (our rate of decline
of the magnetic field toward the cluster outskirts). Multi-frequency data will be
needed to better constrain these parameters and to break these degeneracies.

Assuming a fraction of 10\% radio-loud clusters, we demonstrate that our model
matches the NVSS radio halo luminosity function
\citep[RLF,][]{1999NewA....4..141G}. However, the high-luminosity tail of our
model RLF is subject to cosmic variance because of the comparably small
simulation volume of $1 h^{-3}\,\rmn{Gpc}^3$. Interestingly, the RLF derived
from the $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}-L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ relation differs at high radio
luminosities from the NVSS RLF; possibly because of selection and incompleteness
effects that are not fully taken into account. The comparison between different
RLFs suggests that the low-luminosity (low-mass) regime is the most promising
place to differentiate between various models.

It is expected that the next-generation of low-frequency radio surveys will
probe this regime. Hence, we we make prediction for the LOFAR cluster survey, in
particular, we compute the 120~MHz RLF and the cumulative RH number
density. Given our assumption, we would expect the LOFAR Tier~1 survey at
120~MHz to detect about $\sim$3500 RHs above the flux limit of 0.5~mJy. Since
the detectable number of RHs is approximately proportional to the (uncertain)
radio-loud fraction, we caution that the precise number depends strongly on the
underling assumptions. In particular, we assume that the model parameters can be
extrapolated down to cluster masses of about
$M_{200}\approx1.4\times10^{14}$~$h_{70}^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}$ without any break in
the radio scaling relation that would indicate additional scales in the physics.
Most of the RHs in our sample lie at low masses and thus at low luminosities
that are unconstrained by current observations. If, e.g., the magnetic field
and/or the CR distribution in clusters are not statistically self-similar and
would exhibit much reduced strength/number density on group scales, our
predictions for the detectable number of RHs would be dramatically reduced.

This demonstrates the potential of LOFAR, and other next-generation
low-sensitivity radio instruments such as APERTIF, EVLA and SKA, in determining
the RLF properties. In combination with future X-ray missions like eROSITA, this
should yield a robust determination of the number of clusters hosting RHs at a
given luminosity (mass) and thus elucidate the relation of the radio emission
with the cluster dynamical state. This will be crucial in determining the
parameter values for the hadronic model and eventually in elucidating the RH
generation mechanism.

Summarizing, in this work we have constructed a model for the ICM and CR
distributions in galaxy clusters that enabled us to provide a cosmologically
complete multi-frequency mock catalog for the (non-)thermal cluster emission at
different redshifts. We will make these catalogs publicly and freely available
on-line through the MultiDark database (www.multidark.org). Those contain the
quantities $\rho_{\rmn{gas}}$, $L_{\rmn{X, bol}}$, $Y_{\rmn{X}}$,
$Y_{\rmn{SZ}}$, $L_{120~\rmn{GHz}}$, $L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}$ and $L_{\gamma}$ (among
many others). We hope that the community can make valuable use of these
catalogues in synergy with the future radio, X-ray and gamma-ray data.

\section{Cosmic Ray Modeling Details}
\label{app:B}

Here, we describe in detail how our \emph{hybrid} model for the CR distribution
in galaxy clusters of Section~\ref{sec:2.3} is constructed by generalizing the
analytical results by \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}.

As anticipated in Section~\ref{sec:2.3}, when advection dominates the CR
transport, the CR normalization can be expressed as in
Equation~(\ref{eq:Csimple_1}). However, when CR streaming and diffusion
dominates, the CR distribution is modified and flattens considerably. This can
be shown analytically by solving the continuity equation for CRs and obtaining
the CR density profile, $\rho_{\rmn{CR}}$, of
Equation~(\ref{eg:rhoCR_1}). Assuming $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rmn{e}}(R)/n_{0}$, i.e.,
neglecting the temperature dependence, and adopting a standard $\beta$-profile
for the electron density,
%
\begin{equation}
n_{\rmn{e}} = n_{0} \left( 1+\frac{R^{2}}{R_{\rmn{c}}^{2}} \right)^{-\frac{3\beta_{\rmn{cl}}}{2}} \, ,
\label{eq:beta_profile}
\end{equation}
% 
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} find that the solution of Equation~(\ref{eg:rhoCR_1}) is physical only 
for $\rho_{\rmn{CR}}$ within the radial range $R_{-} < R < R_{+}$ with
%
\begin{equation}
R_{\pm} = \frac{3\beta_{\rmn{cl}}}{2\gamma}R_{*}\left(1\pm\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{2R_{\rmn{c}}\gamma}{3\beta_{\rmn{cl}}R_{*}}\right)^{2}}\right) \, ;
\label{eq:Rpm}
\end{equation} 
%
while it is non-stationary outside these radii. In these regions, the authors
suggest to set $\rho_{\rmn{CR}}(R) = \rho_{\rm{CR}}(R_{\pm})$ for $R > R_{+}$
and $R < R_{-}$, respectively. \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} obtain the profile for
the CR normalization,
$C(R)=C_{0}(\rho_{\rmn{CR}}(R)/\rho_{\rmn{CR},0})^{\beta_{\rmn{CR}}}$, as
%
\begin{equation}
C(R) = C_{0}\left( 1+ \frac{R^{2}}{R_{C}^{2}} \right)^{-\beta_{\rmn{c}}} \rmn{exp}\left( {\frac{R}{R_{*}}\beta_{\rmn{CR}}} \right)
\label{eq:Ctransport}
\end{equation} 
%
for $R_{-}<R<R_{+}$, where
$\beta_{\rmn{c}}=3\beta_{\rmn{cl}}~\beta_{\rmn{CR}}/2\gamma$, and $C(R) =
C(R_{\pm})$ for $R<R_{-}$ and $R>R_{+}$, respectively. In this way, different CR
transport cases are parametrized through $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$.  A high value of
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ characterizes the advection-dominated case, while the CR
profile is flat for $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}} \sim1$. We refer the reader to
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} for an extensive discussion.

We want to extend this result to account for (i) our GNFW gas profiles of
Section~\ref{sec:2.2}, (ii) the universal temperature drop in the cluster
outskirts, and (iii) merge it with the universal cluster mass-scaling of the CR
normalization, $\tilde{C}$, obtained from hydrodynamical simulations
\citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P}.  Therefore, we adopt the hybrid profile,
$C_{\rm{hybrid}} = \tilde{C}(R) (\rho_{\rmn{gas}}(R)/m_\rmn{p}) (T(R)/T_0)$, of
Equation~(\ref{eq:Cf}). We note that for such a choice, there does not any more
exist an analytical solution to Equation~(\ref{eg:rhoCR_1}) as in
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}. This results in a 5-order equation and a numerical
solution would not be of practical use for every cluster in our large MultiDark
sample. For simplicity, we adopt the formulae above also for our hybrid
model. I.e., we adopt
$C(R)=C_{0}(\rho_{\rmn{CR}}(R)/\rho_{\rmn{CR},0})^{\beta_{\rmn{CR}}}$ within
$R_{\pm}$ of Equation~(\ref{eq:Rpm}), with $\rho_{\rmn{CR}}$ defined by
Equation~(\ref{eg:rhoCR_1}) where $C_{\rmn{hybrid}}$ enters through the
advective CR profile, $\eta(R)$, of Equation~(\ref{eq:eta}), and $C(R) =
C(R_{\pm})$ for $R > R_{+}$ and $R < R_{-}$, respectively.  Note that, in our
formalism, $R_{\rmn{c}}$ of Equation~(\ref{eq:Rpm}) becomes the characteristic
radius of our GNFW gas profile of Section~\ref{sec:2.2}, i.e., $R_{\rmn{c}} =
0.2 R_{500}$, and $\beta_{\rmn{cl}}=0.8$ (we checked that varying the value of
$\beta_{\rmn{cl}}$ between 0.4 and 1.2 has no impact).  The relevant factors are
$\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ and the exponential factor of
Equation~(\ref{eg:rhoCR_1}). As we will see in the following, the two radii
$R_{\pm}$ are not critically affected by the form of $\eta(R)$. Therefore,
despite the approximation, this approach captures the main CR transport effects.

Assuming our GNFW gas profile instead of a standard $\beta$-profile for the
electron density, so adopting $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rmn{e,GNFW}}(R)/n_{0}$, there
exist an exact analytical solution to Equation~(\ref{eg:rhoCR_1}) as in
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}. In order to evaluate the systematic error that we
are introducing with the approach described above, in
Figure~\ref{fig:REXexactVSfake}, we compare the \emph{exact} solution for $C(R)$
in the case of our GNFW profile with the \emph{approximate} solution where we
use the formulae by \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}, and only substitute the electron
$\beta$-profile for our GNFW profiles (with $R_{\rmn{c}} = 0.2 R_{500}$,
$\beta_{\rmn{cl}}=0.8$). In this last case, we fix $R_{-}=10^{-3}R/R_{200}$ to
mimic the typical $R_{-}$ value of the exact solution, otherwise an unphysical
step feature would appear at $\leq10^{-2}R/R_{200}$. This latter approximation
is kept in our hybrid model, which however has no impact on the model surface
brightness and total luminosity. There is almost no difference between the two
cases, as shown by Figure~\ref{fig:REXexactVSfake}. This shows that the approach
presented here to construct our hybrid model can be safely followed in order to
derive a fully working parametrization which captures the main CR transport
effects.

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/CR_profiles_REXexactVSfake.eps}
\caption{Comparison of the exact and approximate solutions for $C(R)$ in the
  case of our GNFW profile. In the latter case, we use the formulae by
  \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} but adopt $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rmn{e,GNFW}}(R)/n_{0}$,
  i.e., we assume an isothermal ICM. We show the GNFW profiles for NCCCs
  and CCCs, as derived in Section~\ref{sec:2.2}. For each of these profile
  classes, we show three different cases of $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$, 10, and 1
  (top to bottom). We normalize $C(R)$ for the advection dominated case
  ($\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$) at $R=10^{-3}R_{200}$ and and require CR number
  conservation during CR streaming. Note that the value for 
  $C(10^{-3}R_{200},\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100)$ in the CCC case is identical
  for the exact solution and its approximation, while there is a small
  difference of about 9\% in the NCCC case. We adopt $\alpha=2.3$.}

%\caption{Comparison of different CR profiles. The left plot shows the \emph{simple} advective $C_{\rmn{adv}}$ of Equation~(\ref{eq:Csimple_1}) for the Coma and Perseus cases both neglecting the temperature dependence ($\rho$) and considering it ($P$). The temperature profile of Coma has been modified so that it follows the characteristic decline toward the cluster periphery. Perseus is a CCC and it is characterized by a central dip in the temperature profile which may importantly affect the final CR profile, so we adopt the temperature profile as given in \cite{2003ApJ...590..225C} ($P_{1}$). We also show the case where we only apply the characteristic decline toward the cluster periphery ($P_{2}$). The other two right plots show the \emph{transport} case of Equation~(\ref{eq:Ctransport}) for Coma and Perseus for different values of $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ in comparison with the \emph{simple} case. Additionally shown is the result in case of $C(R)=C_{\rmn{semi-analytical}}(R)=\tilde{C}(R)\rho_{\rmn{gas}}(R)/m_{\rmn{p}}$ where $\tilde{C}(R)$ is the mass-dependent universal normalization CR profile found in cosmological simulations \citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. The \emph{simple} and \emph{semi-analytical} profiles are normalized at $C_{0}=C(0)$. In the transport case, we fix the CR number for $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}=100$ using Equation~(36) of \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}, while integrating the cluster volume within $R_{200}$, and require CR number conservation during CR streaming. We adopt $\alpha=2.3$.}

%\end{figure*}
%
%
%In Figure~\ref{fig:simpleVStransport}, we show a comparison between $C_{\rmn{adv}}$ of 
%Equation~(\ref{eq:Csimple_1}) and $C$ of Equation~(\ref{eq:Ctransport}) considering the 
%NCCC Coma and CCC Perseus cases. While for Coma we adopt the $\beta$-profile of 
%\citet{1992A&A...259L..31B}, Perseus needs a double-$\beta$ profile. We adopt both the 
%approximation $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rmn{e}}(R)/n_{0}$ and the proper Perseus pressure profile 
%(X-ray data from \citealp{2003ApJ...590..225C}). Note that the \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E} 
%formalism is exact only for the approximation $P(R)/P_{0}=n_{\rmn{e}}(R)/n_{0}$ where $n_{\rmn{e}}$ 
%is a $\beta$-profile. Nevertheless, we adopt the above formulae also for Perseus as a good approximation, 
%i.e., we adopt $C(R)=C_{0}(\rho_{\rmn{CR}}(R)/\rho_{\rmn{CR},0})^{\beta_{\rmn{CR}}}$
%within $R_{\pm}$ of Equation~(\ref{eq:Rpm}), and $C(R) = C(R_{\pm})$ for $R > R_{+}$ 
%and $R < R_{-}$, respectively; we take $R_{\rmn{c}}$ in Equation~(\ref{eq:Rpm}) to be equal to the Perseus 
%double-$\beta$ profile outer core radius and fix $\beta_{\rmn{cl}}=0.8$. The relevant 
%parameters are $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ and the exponential factor of Equation~(\ref{eg:rhoCR_1}). 
%In fact, as we will see in the following, the two radii $R_{\pm}$ are not critically affected 
%by the detail of $\eta(R)$. Therefore, despite the approximation, this approach captures the 
%main CR transport effects also for the Perseus case. 
%
%In Figure~\ref{fig:simpleVStransport}, we additionally show the result in case 
%$C(R)=C_{\rmn{semi-analytical}}(R)=\tilde{C}(R)\rho_{\rmn{\rmn{gas}}}(R)/m_{\rmn{p}}$ 
%where $\tilde{C}(R)$ is the universal normalization CR profile found in cosmological 
%simulations \citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. As expected, the CR profile driven by 
%simulations is characterized by a more centrally peaked profile with respect to the 
%analytical case. Note also the flatter profile of Coma with respect to Perseus, which 
%reflects their NCCC and CCC classification, respectively. Finally, the effect of varying 
%the turbulent cluster state by means of $\gamma_{\rmn{tu}}$ can be clearly appreciated.

\section{Radio Emission}
\label{app:A}

The factor $A_{\nu}$ in the equation for the radio synchrotron emissivity,
Equation~(\ref{eq:jnu}), is given by (see also \citealp{2008MNRAS.385.1211P} and
\citealp{2011A&A...527A..99E})
%
\begin{equation}
A_{\nu} = A_{\rmn{E_{synch}}} \frac{16^{2-\alpha_{\rmn{e}}}\sigma_{\rmn{pp}}m_{\rmn{e}}c^{2}}{(\alpha_{\rmn{e}}-2)\sigma_{\rmn{T}}\epsilon_{B_{\rmn{C}}}m_{\rmn{p}}}\left(\frac{m_{\rmn{p}}
}{m_{\rmn{e}}}\right)^{\alpha_{\rmn{e}}-2} \left(\frac{m_{\rmn{e}}c^{2}}{\rmn{GeV}}\right)^{\alpha_{\rmn{e}}-1} \, ,
\end{equation}
%
with
%
\begin{equation}
A_{\rmn{E_{synch}}} = \frac{\sqrt{3\pi}}{32\pi}\frac{B_{\rmn{c}}e^{3}}{m_{\rmn{e}}c^{2}}\frac{\alpha_{\rmn{e}}+\frac{7}{3}}{\alpha_{\rmn{e}}+1}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{3\alpha_{\rmn{e}}-1}{12}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{3\alpha_{\rmn{e}}+7}{12}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{\alpha_{\rmn{e}}+5}{4}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{\alpha_{\rmn{e}}+7}{4}\right)} \, ,
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha_{\rmn{e}}=\alpha+1$, the effective inelastic cross-section for
proton-proton interactions is $\sigma_{\rmn{pp}} =
32~(0.96+\rmn{e}^{4.42-2.4\alpha})$, $B_{\rmn{c}} = \sqrt{ 8 \pi
  \epsilon_{B_{\rmn{c}}}} \simeq 31 \left( \nu/\rmn{GHz} \right)~\mu$G, and
$\Gamma$ is the Gamma-function
\citep{1965hmfw.book.....A}. $A_{\rmn{E_{synch}}}$ is given in units of erg, and
$A_{\nu}$ is given in units of erg~cm$^{3}$~g$^{-1}$~sr$^{-1}$.

The generalization of the radio emissivity, $j_{\nu}$, to account for three CR populations,
each characterized by different power-law spectra and the inclusion of the
normalization parameter $g_{\rmn{CR}}$, following \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}, is
straight forward. We obtain
%
\begin{eqnarray}
j_{\nu,\rmn{hybrid}} & = &g_{\rmn{CR}} C(R) \rho_{\rmn{gas}}(R) \frac{\epsilon_{\rmn{B}}(R)}{\epsilon_{\rmn{B}}(R)+\epsilon_{\rmn{CMB}}} \nonumber \\
& \times & \Sigma_{i=1}^{3} \Delta_{i} A_{\nu,i} \left( \frac{\epsilon_{\rmn{B}}(R)}{\epsilon_{B_{\rmn{c}}}} \right)^{\frac{\alpha_{i}-2}{4}}  \, ,
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the sum is over the three CR spectral indexes $\alpha_{i}=(2.55,2.3,2.15)$
with the corresponding factors $\Delta_{i} = (0.767, 0.143, 0.0975)$ found by
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}.

\section{Gamma-ray Emission}
\label{app:C}

The gamma-ray flux above an energy $E_{\gamma}$ is given by (see, e.g.,
\citealp{2010MNRAS.409..449P})
%
\begin{equation}
F_{\gamma} (>E_{\gamma}) = \frac{1}{4\pi D^{2}} \int dV  \lambda_{\gamma}(R)\, ,
\end{equation}
%
where the omnidirectional (i.e., integrated over the $4\pi$ solid angle)
gamma-ray emissivity above $E_{\gamma}$ is $ \lambda_{\gamma}(R)=A_{\gamma} C(R)
\rho_{\rmn{gas}}(R)$. The parameter $A_{\gamma}$ is \citep{2010MNRAS.409..449P}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
A_{\gamma} = g_{\rmn{CR}} D_{\gamma,\rmn{break}} \frac{4 m_{\pi^{0}} c}{3 m_{\rmn{p}}^{2}} \Sigma_{i=1}^{3} \Delta_{i} \frac{\sigma_{\rmn{pp},i}}{\alpha_{i} \delta_{i}} \left( \frac{m_{\rmn{p}}}{2 m_{\pi^{0}}} \right)^{\alpha_{i}} \times \nonumber \\
\times \left[ \beta_{x} \left( \frac{\alpha_{i}+1}{2\delta_{i}}, \frac{\alpha_{i}-1}{2\delta_{i}} \right) \right]_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} \, ,
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $x_{j}=\{ 1 + [ m_{\pi^{0}}c^2/(2E_{\gamma,j})]^{2\sigma_{i}} \}$, $\left[ \beta_{x}(a,b) \right]_{x_1}^{x_2} =
\beta_{x_2}(a,b)-\beta_{x_1}(a,b)$ where $\beta$ denotes the incomplete
Beta-function \citep{1965hmfw.book.....A}, and
$\delta_{i}=0.14\alpha_{i}^{-1.6}+0.44$. The term $D_{\gamma,
  \rmn{break}}=D_{\gamma}(E_{\gamma},E_{\gamma,\rmn{break}})$ represents
diffusive CR losses due to escaping protons from the cluster at the equivalent
photon energy for the break $E_{\gamma, \rmn{break}}$ (see
\citealp{2010MNRAS.409..449P} for details). $A_{\gamma}$ is given in units of
cm$^3$~s$^{-1}$~g$^{-1}$.

\section{Observational Radio-to-X-ray Scaling relation and Luminosity Function}
\label{app:D}

For comparison with the observed 1.4~GHz radio-to-X-ray scaling relation, we
include almost all RHs of the sample by \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}. We exclude
RXCJ1314.4-2515 and Z7160 because they lack bolometric X-ray measurements, and
A2626 because its X-ray luminosity is very low placing it as an extreme
outlier. We add to our sample the clusters Ophiuchus, A2029 and A1835
\citep{2009A&A...499..371G}. The bolometric X-ray luminosities,
$L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$, of clusters hosting giant radio halos are taken from
\cite{2009A&A...507..661B}, while $L_{\rmn{X,bol}}$ values of cluster hosting
for mini-halos are taken from \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R},
\cite{Boehringer:1998vv} and ACCEPT. In the cases where measurement
uncertainties for X-ray and radio luminosities are not reported, we adopt a
$10\%$ uncertainty. Our final RH sample has a median redshift of
$z\approx0.18$. In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:PLSZ}, we show the
corresponding radio-to-X-ray scaling relation which is well fit by $\log_{10}
(L_{1.4~\rmn{GHz}}/h_{70}^{-2}~\rmn{erg}~\rmn{s}^{-1}~\rmn{Hz}^{-1}) = A +
B~\log_{10} (L_{ \rmn{X,bol}}/h_{70}^{-2}~\rmn{erg}~\rmn{s}^{-1})$, with
$A=-50.433\pm2.226$, $B=1.803\pm0.049$, and scatter $\sigma_{yx} \approx
0.44$. Regarding the clusters with upper limits on the diffuse radio emission in
the sample of \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}, we select only those 8 clusters with
ACCEPT measurements.

In Figure~\ref{fig:RLFobs}, we make an attempt to construct an RLF from existing
X-ray flux-limited radio surveys. There exist two such studies: the
\cite{1999NewA....4..141G} survey with NVSS at $1.4$~GHz and the
\cite{VenturiGMRT_1,VenturiGMRT_2} survey with GMRT at $610$~MHz by. We only
select RHs, i.e., we do not consider radio relics or other diffuse radio
emissions of unclear classification. The 1.4~GHz NVSS survey contains 13~RHs out
of 205 analyzed clusters while the 610~MHz GMRT survey contains 6 RHs out of the
34 observed. The sample finally analyzed by \cite{VenturiGMRT_1,VenturiGMRT_2}
is composed by 50 clusters and we can also build a corresponding RLF at 1.4~GHz
using the 12 present RHs. The fraction of radio-loud clusters is about 6\%, 18\%
and 24\% for the NVSS 1.4~GHz, GMRT 610~MHz and GMRT 1.4~GHz sample,
respectively. The corresponding median redshift is 0.18, 0.26 and 0.25. We
calculate the RLF using the classical $V_{\rmn{max}}$ estimator (see, e.g.,
\citealp{1976ApJ...207..700F}) correcting for the sample incompleteness and
survey sky coverage. The most problematic aspect in obtaining these RLFs, apart
from the few available objects, is the calculation of a meaningful flux
limit. We obtain such a limit by fitting the upper envelope of the
luminosity-distance distribution of a given sample, as shown in the insets of
Figure~\ref{fig:RLFobs}, following the procedure adopted by
\cite{2011arXiv1106.5494B}. Note that it is particularly ambiguous to calculate
a meaningful flux limit for the GMRT survey due to its poor luminosity-distance
distribution. We decide therefore to take the 1.4~GHz NVSS RLF as reference in
our comparisons with observation. However, we want to stress that several issues
can affect this result, such as the small sample size that impacts the resulting
flux limit, and the Malmquist and Eddington biases. Indeed, the very different
fraction of radio loud clusters obtained from different samples is one clear
indicator of the large uncertainty in the RLF.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/RLF_observations.eps}
\caption{RH luminosity function obtained from existent observations. The insets
  show the sample luminosity-distance distributions (see main text for details)
  where the solid line is the fit to the upper envelope population (indicated in
  green) employed to calculate the flux limit for the classical $V_{\rmn{max}}$
  estimator. The choice of the upper envelope population is somehow arbitrary,
  particularly in the GMRT cases due to the poor luminosity--distance
  distributions. The horizontal error bars represent the mass bins while the
  vertical error bars are Poissonian uncertainties.}
\label{fig:RLFobs}
\end{figure}

%Finally, in Figure~\ref{fig:RLF1.4_fluxNVSS}, we compare the cumulative number of RHs above a certain flux limit at 1.4~GHz obtained by our model realization described in Section~\ref{sec:4}, adopting a fraction of 10\% of radio-loud clusters, with the NVSS survey result (data is taken from \citealp{2010A&A...509A..68C}). We repeat the steps done in Section~5.2 in order to obtain an analytical model describing the number of RHs expected in our model per unit luminosity and per unit comoving volume. We then use Equation~(\ref{eq:NtotRH}) to calculate the cumulative number of RHs above a given flux. The luminosity integration is limited to $\log_{10} L_{1.4~\rmn{120MHz}} \geq 28$ to exclude the turn-over at low luminosities caused by incompleteness, while the redshift integration is limited to the range covered by the NVSS survey of $0.044 \leq z \leq 0.2$ \citep{1999NewA....4..141G}. We find a agreement comparison between our model and the observational result of the NVSS survey.

%\del{In comparing with observations, we take as reference
%  \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M}. There are however many other works on this scaling
%  relation, in particularly we recall the HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster
%  Sample (HIFLUGCS; \citealp{2002ApJ...567..716R}), the REXCESS
%  \citep{2009A&A...498..361P} sample, and the 115 \emph{Chandra} cluster sample
%  of \cite{2007ApJ...668..772M}. The results on the slopes of the $L-M$ relation
%  can vary significantly between different samples. While the slope of
%  \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} is $1.63\pm0.06$,
%  \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R}\footnote[8]{Note that we are quoting the
%    $L_{\rmn{bol}}-M_{200}$ results of \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R}.} found values
%  between $1.72\pm0.09$ and $1.89\pm0.08$ (depending on the fit procedure, which

%  $2.08\pm0.13$ and \cite{2007ApJ...668..772M} found
%  $1.96\pm0.10$. Discrepancies can come from many different sources but likely
%  are to be charged to the selection criteria of the different samples as
%  recently pointed out also by \cite{2011arXiv1109.3708R}. Samples which differ
%  in e.g.~redshift distribution, mass range, fitting procedure and biases
%  treatment, and, of course, the used instrument, can give and actually gave
%  different results. Therefore we decided to take as reference the
%  \cite{2010MNRAS.406.1773M} work because it is very recent, their sample is
%  composed by a high number (238) of objects, and, more importantly, their
%  analysis takes self-consistently into account all selection effects,
%  covariances, systematic uncertainties and the cluster mass function (see also
%  \citealp{2010MNRAS.406.1759M}).}
